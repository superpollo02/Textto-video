/**
 * Brand-keyed transition pool for AI-generated custom templates.
 *
 * WHY: the old `GeneratedTransition` was a single-layer overlay painted on the
 * last ~15 frames of the OUTGOING scene only — the incoming scene never moved,
 * so it read as a masked cut, not a real transition. This pool returns true
 * `@remotion/transitions` presentations (slide / wipe / iris / flip / clockWipe
 * / fade) where the incoming and outgoing scenes genuinely overlap and move
 * together, exactly like the built-in templates (economist/spotlight/chronicle).
 * Driven by `TransitionSeries` in both the render (GeneratedVideo) and the
 * Edit-Template preview (ContinuousCustomComposition), so preview === render.
 *
 * Selection is keyed by the OUTGOING scene index against the brand's motion
 * personality (`theme.motion.transitionFamily`), so identical input always
 * renders identical transitions (reproducible) and the inter-brand distinctness
 * lever stays the brand signature — a calm brand (fade/ink_wash) and a bold one
 * (page_flip/whip_blur) get visibly different rhythms from the same engine. Each
 * move also rotates its DIRECTION by index, so a brand with a small family still
 * gets varied handoffs (left/right/up/down) instead of the same move every cut.
 *
 * NOTE: keep this file byte-identical to the frontend mirror at
 * frontend/src/components/remotion/generated/generatedTransitions.ts.

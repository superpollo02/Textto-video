/**
 * droplet_intro__v2 — "Open Water".
 *
 * Opening-scene variant of `droplet_intro`. Same props, different composition.
 *
 * Where the base shows a droplet falling into a flat elliptical ripple pond
 * with the copy stacked at the bottom, this variant is a live water surface:
 *
 *   title (top)  →  narration under it  →  open sky  →  swan riding the water
 *
 * The copy sits together at the top, the water fills the lower part of the
 * frame, and the swan rides its surface. The water is real sine geometry with
 * visible crests and troughs, spanning the frame edge to edge.
 *
 * ── Why the water is drawn here instead of with `NeonWater` ──────────────
 * `NeonWater` draws flat `<ellipse>` rings — a pond seen in perspective. It has
 * no sine math and cannot produce crests or troughs at any prop combination.
 * Its viewBox is also 1000×1000 with the default `preserveAspectRatio`, so in
 * landscape it letterboxes to a centred square and its x=0 / x=1000 are NOT the
 * frame edges — it physically cannot reach them. Hence local wave geometry.
 *
 * The sine builder below is copied (not imported) from `laduc/wavePaths.ts`,
 * and the droplet/splash math from the base `DropletIntro.tsx`. Copying is
 * required, not stylistic: the backend copies only `src/templates/<id>/` into
 * each per-project render workspace, so a cross-template import compiles in the
 * Player but breaks the headless render with an unresolved import. (Same reason
 * `useFitText` is duplicated per template — see its docblock.)
 *
 * Filter/uid suffix for this scene: `-div2`. SVG filter, gradient and mask IDs
 * are document-global, so everything introduced here carries that suffix or it
 * collides with another scene mounted in the same Player.

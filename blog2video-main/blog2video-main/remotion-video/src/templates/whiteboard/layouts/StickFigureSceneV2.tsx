 * `bottom`/`width` coupling below depends on), but stands square to camera
 * rather than in profile: symmetric stance, both arms working.

 * stroke by stroke, since it is a person already mid-juggle when the shot
 * begins. Its hands and its balls run off one shared phase, so the catch beat
 * always lands on the hand the ball is actually arriving at.

 * background action behind a board of copy, so legibility beats virtuosity.
 *
 * This is the master clock for the whole rig, not just the balls: the hands'
 * reach, the body's sway and its knee bounce are all derived from
 * `frame / THROW_PERIOD`, so raising this number slows the figure and the

 *
 * It has to clear the head (circle cy=66 r=30, crown y=36) by more than a ball
 * radius. This is the MIDDLE ball's height; the other two are ARC_STAGGER
 * above and below it (see below), so the tallest throw peaks at
 * HAND_Y − ARC_H − ARC_STAGGER.

 * The throws go well ABOVE the head. That takes headroom the original box did
 * not have: with the old `0 0 420 370` viewBox the ceiling capped ARC_H at 126,
 * which peaked the top ball at y=26 against a crown at y=36 — ten units, so the
 * balls hovered level with the head instead of arcing over it.
 *
 * The viewBox is therefore extended UPWARD to `0 -160 420 530` (see the svg
 * below). Shifting the origin rather than the height keeps every existing
 * coordinate valid — the feet stay at y=308 — and puts all the new room above
 * the figure. The svg's `bottom` offsets are shifted by the same amount to keep
 * the feet planted on the ground line; the two are coupled, so changing one
 * means recomputing the other.
 *
 * With hands at 150, ARC_H 240 and ARC_STAGGER 16, the tallest ball peaks at
 * y=-106 — about 142 units clear of the crown — and its top edge sits at
 * y=-124, inside the extended box's -160 ceiling with room to spare.
 * `ink-sfv2` has a bounded filter region and clips what leaves it, so a ball
 * outside the box would simply vanish and the pattern would look like it had
 * dropped one. ARC_H and HAND_Y trade against each other here: the arc is
 * measured up from the hands, so raising the hands must lower ARC_H by the same

     starts and again at the catch, and taking a max across the three balls let
     the value snap from one ball's ramp onto another's partway through.

          y=-160, height 530) to give the throws room to clear the head. Because
          only the origin moved, every coordinate in the rig is unchanged.

          11.7% of the taller box now sits BELOW the feet (62 of 530), so
          `bottom` is offset to put them exactly on the scene's ground line
          rather than the svg's own lower edge. Note the offsets themselves do
          NOT change when the box is extended: the below-feet margin is a fixed
          62 units, so as the box grows its FRACTION shrinks in exact step with

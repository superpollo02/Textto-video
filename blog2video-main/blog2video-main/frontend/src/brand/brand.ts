/**
 * Brand resolution.
 *
 * One Vite build serves two marketing brands from the same SPA: blog2video
 * (URL in, video out) and pdf2video (document in, video out). Everything past
 * the landing page — auth, dashboard, pipeline, pricing — is shared, so the
 * brand only decides which landing page renders at "/" and which domain the SEO
 * tags point at.
 *
 * This is a Vite SPA, not Next.js: there is no middleware to branch on the
 * request host. Resolution is therefore build-time (VITE_BRAND, which the
 * prerender step in scripts/build-seo.ts runs under) with a runtime hostname
 * fallback so a single deployment attached to both domains still does the right
 * thing in the browser.

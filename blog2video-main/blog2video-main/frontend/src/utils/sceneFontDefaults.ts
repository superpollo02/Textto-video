/**
 * Resolve a custom-template scene's DEFAULT type sizes.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
 * --------------------
 * `scene_font_defaults` is stored per template as
 * `{intro, content: [...], outro}`, indexed like `content_codes`. Four surfaces
 * need to turn that into one pair of numbers for one scene, and before this
 * file each did it differently — or not at all:
 *
 *   the exported MP4      services/remotion.py, by role + contentVariantIndex
 *   the gallery preview   CustomPreview.tsx, by role + content index
 *   the project preview   NOTHING — it fell through to the literal baked into
 *                         the generated code, so the preview and the MP4
 *                         disagreed about type size on every template that has
 *                         stored defaults
 *   the editor's sliders  NOTHING — `resolveDefaultFontSizesForScene` fell all
 *                         the way through to LAYOUT_FONT_DEFAULTS.default, a
 *                         hardcoded 72/30 unrelated to the template. Because
 *                         the editor DELETES a value equal to "the default",
 *                         a user deliberately choosing 72 had it silently
 *                         dropped.
 *
 * One resolver, so those four cannot drift again.
 *
 * KEYED BY THE VARIANT THAT RENDERS THE SCENE, NOT BY POSITION. Which component
 * draws a scene is decided by archetype matching, so the scene at position 3 may
 * render `content_0` and must receive content_0's defaults. This mirrors
 * remotion.py exactly; the two must agree about what a scene IS.

 *     deterministically rather than by generated code. It has no stored entry
 *     and must not borrow a neighbour's. Recognised by having NO
 *     contentVariantIndex: nothing in `content[]` corresponds to it.
 *   a template's OWN chart scene — since the data-visualisation layout became a
 *     required design role, each template generates its own, which IS a content
 *     variant with code, sample copy and a `content[i]` slot like any other. It
 *     must resolve its entry, or its type sizes fall back to the literal baked
 *     into the generated code and the editor's sliders have no default to show.
 *
 * So the discriminator is the variant index, not the scene type.

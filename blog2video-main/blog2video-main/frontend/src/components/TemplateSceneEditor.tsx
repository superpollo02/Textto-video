/**
 * The single edit modal for a custom template: name, colours, rating AND
 * per-scene AI editing.
 *
 * These were two modals — this one and CustomTemplateEditor — that unmounted
 * each other and handed back and forth. Because they wrote different fields,
 * switching ran a window.confirm that DISCARDED unsaved edits. Merging removes
 * both the round trip and the data loss; CustomTemplateEditor is gone.
 *
 * Scene editing: pick a scene -> describe the change -> the backend regenerates
 * that ONE scene into a DRAFT -> preview draft vs published side by side ->
 * apply or discard. The published template is never touched until Apply, so a
 * bad edit costs nothing.
 *
 * Preview needs no new render infrastructure: CustomPreview already compiles
 * scene code in the browser and takes the theme as a prop. Which scenes it is
 * given is the whole mechanism —
 *   - "All scenes" hands it everything, so it plays the finished template;
 *   - a single scene hands it just that code, making it a one-scene preview.
 * Colour edits preview live by passing the EDITED theme rather than the saved
 * one, so nothing has to be saved to be seen.

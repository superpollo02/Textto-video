/**
 * drawn_title__v3 — "Rope Haul".
 *
 * Variant of `drawn_title`. Same props, different composition: a stick figure
 * stands on a stool and hauls the title/narration placard in from off-frame left
 * on a rope, hand over hand. Once the placard is centred the rope goes slack and
 * the figure turns to point at it.
 *
 * ── How the rope stays attached ────────────────────────────────────────
 * The placard's copy is real HTML (`useFitText` measures DOM nodes to auto-shrink
 * the title and narration), while the figure and rope are SVG. They are kept in
 * contact by authoring the whole scene in the FIGURE's viewBox units and
 * converting to page px with one scale factor, `s`.
 *
 * The rope is not a fixed-length path that happens to line up. Both of its
 * endpoints are the SAME expressions that place the hand and the placard's
 * anchor, so it is attached by construction and cannot detach or stretch.
 *
 * The rope also never shortens — a rope that gets shorter is a rubber band.
 * Instead the slack the figure takes in is expressed as SAG: taut while hauling,
 * dipping on each recovery, and hanging loose once the placard has landed.
 *
 * The placard advances only during haul strokes, so the copy visibly moves
 * *because* the figure pulls rather than drifting on its own clock.
 *
 * Filter IDs carry a `-dtv3` suffix: SVG filter IDs are document-global, and
 * two scenes mounted in the same Player would otherwise collide.

     rule is centred in that band.

     It SCALES with the title, rather than being a fixed 28-34px: a measured
     text height stops at the last line's box, but a face's descenders (and the
     marker face's generous overshoot) hang below that. At large title sizes a
     fixed band left the rule crowding — visually striking through — the final
     line. Tying the band to the type keeps the same optical clearance at every
     size, with a floor so small copy still gets a real gap. */

     ways: extra title lines push up into the space above, extra narration lines
     push down into the space below, and the block stays visually anchored
     instead of drifting off one end. (Anchoring the top pushed long copy down
     onto the hauler; anchoring the bottom drove long titles off the top of the
     frame.) LANDSCAPE keeps the simpler top-anchored stack — the copy is short
     there and the figure sits beside it, so downward growth is harmless. */

     Both endpoints ARE the placard anchor and the lead hand — the same values
     used to draw them — so the rope is attached by construction.

     Sag, not shortening, absorbs the slack the figure takes in. It is at its
     tightest mid-haul and dips on every recovery, which is what sells the rope
     as a rope rather than a drawn line that happens to connect two things. */

     Sag applies only here. The flat rule section under the title never sags —
     it is lying on the page.

     A rope under its own weight hangs BELOW the straight line between its two
     ends. In SVG, +y is DOWN, so the control point must be pushed to a LARGER
     y than the straight-line midpoint. Placing the control near the rule's own
     height (as a small fraction of the drop) instead pulls the curve up above
     the chord, which reads as a bow bending the wrong way.

     So: start from the true midpoint of the span and add the sag downward. */
  /* The control point pulls the curve only about HALF way toward itself, so the
     visible droop is roughly sag/2 — the multiplier is sized for the drawn
     result, not the raw offset. There is a small floor so the rope is never a
     mathematically straight line even at full tension. */

     travel. The copy column there is nearly frame-wide, so by the time it is
     fully home the rule would have run past the figure and off the right edge.
     Letting go during the final glide keeps the rope from ever overshooting,
     and reads as the hauler giving the last of the slack a shove. Landscape has
     the room, so it holds on until the point. */

 * per-run stage plus a scene counter; this surfaces them.
 *
 * Styled to match the video-generation loader in ProjectView (regenerate-script
 * / language-change): a thin purple fill bar above a row of INDEPENDENT circles
 * with labels beneath — done circles green, the active one purple with a ring,
 * upcoming ones grey. A user waiting on a long run meets the same shape of thing
 * whether that run is a video or a template.
 *
 * Deliberately rendered on WHITE rather than in the brand's own palette: while a
 * template is generating its theme is the one thing not yet proven, and a dark
 * brand background made the status text hard to read on the very cards that most
 * needed reading.

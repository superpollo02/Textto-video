/**
 * Brand logo for the TEMPLATE PREVIEW bookends (intro/outro) only.
 *
 * This is deliberately NOT the corner watermark `LogoOverlay` draws. In a real
 * project the logo is a watermark whose corner the user picks; here it is the
 * subject, so a person browsing the gallery sees the brand up front.
 *
 * It is composited by CustomPreview OVER the scene, never passed to the scene as
 * `props.logoUrl` — generated scene code hardcodes its own logo size (28-44px on
 * a 1920px canvas), which is the "logo is very small" defect. Owning the size
 * here is the whole point.
 *
 * ## Why this measures the scene
 *
 * Generated bookends do not leave a reliable empty band. Many centre their copy
 * vertically and fill the frame, so a fixed hero slot painted straight through
 * the headline. There is no static signal for "is the top of this scene free" —
 * it differs per template and per orientation — so the only honest answer is to
 * look at what the scene actually painted, at runtime, and place accordingly:
 *
 *   - hero band clear  → large centred logo in the upper region (the intent)
 *   - hero band busy   → smaller logo tucked into the emptiest top corner
 *
 * Either way it never sits on top of text.

        question: "How is this different from a generic AI carousel generator?",
        answer:
          "Generic carousel generators usually start from a single prompt or idea and produce a templated hook-list-CTA sequence. Blog2Video starts from your actual article structure, so the carousel follows your real argument and examples instead of a generic format.",
      },
      {
        question: "What if I want to edit slides before exporting?",
        answer:
          "You can edit any scene's text, layout, or image after generation and before export, so the final PNG, PDF, or PowerPoint reflects your changes.",

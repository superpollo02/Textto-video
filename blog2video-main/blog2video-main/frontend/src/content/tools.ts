        question: "Does this calculator account for sponsorship revenue?",
        answer:
          "Yes, and it treats it differently from subscription revenue.

A newsletter that is mostly sponsorship-funded gets a wider valuation range than one of the same size funded by subscriptions.",

          "Aim for 50 to 60 characters, which is roughly 600 pixels on desktop. The real limit is pixel width rather than character count, so a title full of wide characters can be truncated below 60 characters while a narrow one can exceed it. This checker measures both.",

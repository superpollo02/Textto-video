"""
LongCat-Video-Avatar-1.5 on Modal serverless GPU — the second avatar rendering provider
(alongside modal-service/omniavatar/, OmniAvatar-1.3B) being integrated into blog2video as
an opt-in "Premium" tier. See docs/longcat-avatar.md for the standalone eval this grew out
of (real render-time/VRAM/cost numbers) and the plan this integration follows.

Bundles the same two-person roster as modal-service/omniavatar/ (avatar_presets/), so a
roster preset choice behaves identically on either provider — only a `custom` portrait needs
its bytes sent inline. See PRESET_IMAGE_FILE below.

Endpoints: GET /ping, GET /lastlog, POST /render. Modelled on
modal-service/omniavatar/app.py's /render contract (single self-contained request, no
/prepare step, X-Render-* timing headers) so the two are easy to compare.

BACKGROUND: this was first attempted on a Hugging Face Space
(hf-space/longcat-avatar-eval/, repurposing the paused firebird-technologies/
echomimic-service Space). That path got the Docker image building correctly (after
fixing three upstream packaging bugs — see the Dockerfile-equivalent comments below,
which carry over unchanged) but then stalled in APP_STARTING with hardware.current still
null for an extended period — HF's L40S provisioning queue, not anything in this code.
Moved to Modal per instruction, reusing the OmniAvatar Modal app's proven image-build
pattern and the exact same dependency fixes already discovered on HF.

GPU: LongCat-Video-Avatar-1.5 needs ~44GB of weights (see WEIGHT_REPOS below) plus
activation memory for a 13.6B-param DiT (INT8) + UMT5 text encoder (bf16) + Whisper-large-v3.
Starting on A100-80GB for headroom; L40S (48GB, OmniAvatar's card) is the fallback if 80GB
proves unnecessary once real numbers exist.

Usage:
    modal run    app.py::download_weights    # one time, ~44GB -> Volume (filtered, see fn)
    modal deploy app.py                      # prints the https://...modal.run URL
    modal serve  app.py                      # ephemeral, hot-reloading, for iteration

    # and model_type=="avatar-v1.5" are both set (EVERY render this service makes
    # — --use_distill is required for v1.5 per upstream's own README). This
    # deployment briefly patched out that override (via sed) to let
    # --text_guidance_scale=4.0 actually take effect, testing whether restoring
    # real classifier-free guidance would let `prompt` steer motion. It did NOT:
    # motion output was frame-identical to guidance=1.0 across every prompt
    # tried (see FIX #5 below for the actual fix, dmd_lora_multiplier). The patch
    # was left live afterward by mistake — CFG at scale 4.0 requires TWO forward
    # passes per denoising step instead of one (see do_classifier_free_guidance in
    # pipeline_longcat_video_avatar.py), which measurably slowed EVERY production
    # render ~2-5x (confirmed against scene_avatar_jobs.duration_seconds: ~80-135
    # sec/segment before this patch existed vs. ~200-1100 sec/segment while it was
    # live) for zero benefit. Reverted: the override block now runs exactly as
    # upstream ships it again, so distilled avatar-v1.5 renders always use the
    # cheap single-forward-pass path. DO NOT reapply without a documented reason —
    # this exact experiment has already been run and disproven once.
    #
    # FIX #5: the REAL suspect for "prompt doesn't affect motion", per
    # meituan-longcat/LongCat-Video#120 — a GitHub issue reporting this EXACT
    # symptom ("Excessive facial expression and motion in v1.5"), where the
    # maintainer (yzhang2016) confirms it is a known, unfixed bug in the public
    # v1.5 checkpoint, and a community member traces it to the DMD distillation
    # LoRA (dmd_lora.safetensors) being loaded at a HARDCODED multiplier=1.0 with
    # no CLI override — applied to every matching Linear layer across the whole
    # DiT (see LongCatVideoAvatarTransformer3DModel.load_lora), not scoped to
    # anything motion-specific, so it can plausibly override/dominate whatever
    # fine-grained conditioning (including text) would otherwise shape the output.
    #
    # This makes the multiplier a real CLI flag (default 1.0 = unchanged
    # behavior) so it can be swept without an image rebuild per attempt. UNTESTED
    # as of this comment — the community's suggested starting point is a low
    # value (~0.1) increased from there; --use_distill (fast, 8-step, LoRA-based)
    # stays the only supported way to run avatar-v1.5 per upstream's README, so
    # this tunes the LoRA's strength rather than disabling distillation outright.
    # Python-based patch, not sed: the insertion needs a literal newline inside a
    # multi-line `a\` append, which is a well-known cross-platform sed footgun
    # (BSD vs GNU sed disagree on the exact escaping) — verified failing under
    # local (BSD) sed during development, so this uses unambiguous str.replace
    # instead of trusting the same quoting to also work under the container's
    # GNU sed untested. Each replace() asserts its target appears EXACTLY once
    # first, so a silent no-op (old text already gone, e.g. upstream renamed
    # something) fails the image build loudly instead of shipping unpatched.

# inference never touches. See docs/longcat-avatar.md §3 for the full accounting; the

#   - LongCat-Video-Avatar-1.5 ships base_model/ (bf16, ~30GB) AND base_model_int8/
#     (~16GB) — only one loads per run, selected by --use_int8. base_model_int8 only,

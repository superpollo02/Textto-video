Root pytest configuration for the Tier A backend test suite.

CRITICAL ISOLATION GUARANTEE
----------------------------
This module sets ``DATABASE_URL`` to a throwaway local SQLite file *before*
``app`` (and therefore ``app.config`` / ``app.database``) is ever imported.
Even if ``.env`` points ``DATABASE_URL`` at the shared Neon develop database,
the test process overrides it here and "fails closed" onto disposable SQLite —
the suite can never read from or write to a real/remote database.

The same env override also neutralises any external credentials so a stray
un-mocked call cannot reach a live service with real keys.

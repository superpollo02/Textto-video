"""Canonical talking-head avatar roster.

A small, fixed set of curated presenter portraits the user can pick from when
enabling "add avatar" on a project. Kept in ONE place so the three consumers
never drift:
  - the backend validator (schemas.py restricts avatar_preset to these ids),
  - the avatar render service (services/avatar.py stages the chosen portrait),
  - the frontend picker (frontend/public/avatars/<id>.jpg thumbnails mirror these).

The portrait image bytes live inside the render service's image (bundled from
modal-service/longcat-avatar/avatar_presets/), so the backend only sends the preset
id — the service resolves it to the bundled file via its own preset map (the
same ids as PRESET_IMAGE_FILE below). See services/avatar.py.

THE ROSTER IS DELIBERATELY TWO PEOPLE. It was five; Maya (woman_blueeyes),
Priya (woman_freckles) and Daniel (man_denim) were cut on 2026-08-07. Two of
their portraits were never committed, so `add_local_dir` shipped an image
advertising five presets while containing three files — a clean deploy resolved
those ids to a path that did not exist. Maya was also DEFAULT_PRESET_ID (this
list's first entry), so every unspecified/invalid preset fell back to a missing
portrait. Only ids whose portrait is committed belong here.

Source portraits are Unsplash (free, model-released) neutral studio-style
photos — deliberately not the Obama/Biden fixtures (public figures) or the
"Lena" CV test image.

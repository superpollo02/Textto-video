# app/services/access.py
"""Membership-aware project access resolution for collaboration.

Central choke point that replaces the old scattered ``Project.user_id == user.id``
ownership filters. A user may access a project if they are the owner OR an accepted
collaborator with a sufficient role. Non-members get a 404 (never 403) so the
existence of a project is not disclosed — preserving the codebase's prior behaviour.

Usage:
    project = get_accessible_project(project_id, user, db)                    # editor+
    project = get_accessible_project(project_id, user, db, required_role="owner")

    ATOMIC, unlike the charge. consume_avatar_credits mutates the ORM object and

    ai_edits_used_this_period FLOORED AT ZERO, unlike a credit balance that only
    ever goes up. This gives back a usage COUNTER, and reset_ai_edit_period()
    zeroes that counter at a billing rollover — so a batch charged just before a
    reset and refunded just after would drive it negative, silently handing the
    user free allowance for the new period. The floor is what stops that; any
    amount that doesn't fit under the floor spills into ai_edit_credits instead

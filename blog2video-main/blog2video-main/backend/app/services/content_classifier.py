Batch content classifier — replaces the 16 per-scene DSPy calls for custom templates.

For each scene's narration, extracts:
  - contentType: "bullets" | "metrics" | "code" | "quote" | "comparison" | "timeline" | "steps" | "plain"
  - structured fields: bullets[], metrics[], codeLines[], quote, quoteAuthor, etc.

Uses ONE cheap Haiku call for ALL scenes instead of 16 expensive Sonnet calls.

class BatchContentExtractor(dspy.Signature):
    """Extract structured content from multiple scene narrations in one pass.

    For EACH scene, analyze the narration and determine:
    1. contentType — what kind of content this is
    2. structured fields — parsed data the component needs to render

    Content types:
    - "bullets" — narration lists multiple items/features/benefits/services/products
    - "steps" — narration describes a sequential process or ordered instructions
    - "metrics" — narration contains specific numbers/statistics/KPIs
    - "code" — narration contains code snippets or technical syntax
    - "quote" — narration contains a direct quote or testimonial
    - "comparison" — narration compares two things (vs, before/after, old/new)
    - "timeline" — narration describes events in chronological order
    - "plain" — general narrative text where NO distinct items can be extracted

    THE SCENE'S LAYOUT IS ALREADY CHOSEN. Each scene carries `layout` and
    `layout_best_for` — the layout it will render in, and ONE SENTENCE saying
    what content that layout is for ("A scannable list of six to eight short
    named items."). Extract the shape THAT SENTENCE DESCRIBES. This is the whole
    job: the layout decides which props the component receives, so content of
    the wrong shape leaves it half-empty and falling back.

    Read the sentence against the scene's own title and narration. It tells you
    not just the KIND of content but how much of it the layout holds well — how
    many items, and how much text each can carry. Extract to fit that.

    WHEN THE NARRATION CANNOT FILL THE LAYOUT, SAY SO — return the type you CAN
    fill and never pad, guess or invent to make a layout look complete. A wrong
    layout is repaired downstream; fabricated content is not repairable, because
    nothing afterwards knows it was invented. This is the one rule that outranks
    matching the layout.

    THE ONE EXCEPTION — `required_content_type`. A scene carrying that field has
    had its layout chosen BY A PERSON, who is looking at the frame and wants it
    filled. There is no downstream repair for that case: the component renders
    the declared shape or renders empty. So for that scene ONLY, return exactly
    the named contentType, using exactly the keys in `required_fields`, and
    re-read the narration through that shape — a sequence of events can be a
    before/after comparison, a two-sided contrast, or a set of steps depending
    on which is asked for. Reshaping what the narration SAYS is expected here;
    inventing facts it does not contain is still forbidden. If the narration
    genuinely carries nothing that can take that shape, return the type you can
    fill and the caller will keep the scene's previous content.

    Scenes marked role "intro" or "outro" are NOT content-routed — the intro
    carries the video's title and the outro the closing CTA. Always return
    "plain" for those, with no structured fields.

    Extraction rules:
    - Extract ONLY content present in the narration — NEVER invent data
    - Choose the type that matches what the narration ACTUALLY contains and what
      the scene's `layout_best_for` sentence asks for. No type is preferred a
      priori.
    USE THESE EXACT FIELD NAMES. The scene component reads these keys and no
    others — a field under any other name is dropped at the render boundary and
    the frame comes out empty, which is precisely what "left"/"right" did to a
    real comparison scene:

{_FIELD_REFERENCE}

    Emit ONLY "contentType" plus that type's fields. A title or a body-text key
    is discarded — the scene takes those from elsewhere.

    EDITABLE PROPS. A scene may also carry `editable_props` — fields the layout
    itself declares (a kicker, a panel label, a caption), each with a key, a
    label and the default the designer wrote. Return a "layoutProps" object
    giving values for them.

    RETURN A KEY ONLY WHERE THE NARRATION GIVES SOMETHING BETTER THAN THE
    DEFAULT, and omit it otherwise — the default then stands. Many defaults are
    deliberate: a panel number derived from the scene's position, a caption left
    empty on purpose. Never invent a value to fill a field, and never restate
    the scene's title or display text in one.

    Notes on the individual types:
    - bullets: including in prose ("offers three services: Go for rides, Eat for
      food, and Get for groceries" → ["Go for rides", "Eat for food",
      "Get for groceries"]). Extract ALL mentioned items, preserving their names.
    - plain: prose with no extractable items, steps or data — the honest answer
      when nothing else fits, not a last resort.

    Output MUST be a valid JSON array with one object per scene.

    """Make each scene's layout and its extracted props agree. Returns layouts.

    Runs after extraction and before the descriptor is written, and is the point
    at which the layout stops being a guess:

      1. BOOKENDS ARE NEVER CONTENT-ROUTED. The intro carries the video's title
         and the outro the CTA, so both are forced to "plain" with their
         structured props stripped. The design stage already does this
         (design_doc.py) and so does sample-copy generation (code_generator.py);
         the project pipeline was the only path without the rule, which is why a
         real intro shipped with a four-item bullet list.

      2. A CONTENT SCENE WHOSE PROPS ITS LAYOUT CANNOT HOLD GETS A NEW LAYOUT.
         The extractor is told to fill the assigned layout and to say so
         honestly when the narration cannot — never to invent. So a mismatch
         here means the content is real and the layout is wrong, and the layout
         is the cheaper of the two to change.

    `layout_content_types` maps layout id -> its taxonomy key
    (`meta["layout_content_types"]`). This check is machine-readable on purpose:
    the prose `best_for` sentence is what the LLM picks with, but a mismatch has
    to be detectable without another model call.

    Mutates `structured_contents` in place (bookend normalisation) and returns
    the layout id per scene, so the caller writes ONE decision to both
    `scene.preferred_layout` and the descriptor.

"""System-wide FIFO queue for avatar render/matte jobs.

WHY THIS EXISTS
The avatar HuggingFace Space (historical) was a single shared GPU render slot
(see services/avatar.py's module docstring). Before this module, "one render at a
time" was enforced per-PROJECT only, via a 409-reject-and-hope-the-client-
retries check in routers/projects.py — two different projects' scenes could
still hit the Space concurrently, and a client had to poll/retry on 409 to
make any progress on a batch. That is fragile and produces exactly the
"409 conflicts from retrying" symptom this module replaces.

THE MODEL
``scene_avatar_jobs`` rows with status="queued" ARE the queue, ordered by
(created_at, id) — strict first-come-first-served across EVERY project and
scene in the system, WITHIN each kind (see below). A single in-process asyncio
dispatcher claims the oldest queued rows and runs each kind up to its own
ceiling, freeing each slot as its job finishes. No per-project reservation
bookkeeping is needed: "a project's scenes start in order" and "two projects'
requests interleave fairly" both still fall out of plain FIFO order.

TWO INDEPENDENT CEILINGS, because the two kinds are bound by different
resources entirely. Counting them together (which this once did) meant cutouts
inherited a limit chosen for GPUs, and five of them thrashed one CPU.

  render (``AVATAR_CONCURRENCY``, default 5) is PROVIDER-BOUND. It was
  hard-coded to 1 for the HF Space, which was a single shared GPU render slot —
  sending it two renders only made them fight. The provider is now Modal, where
  each render gets its OWN container and GPU on demand, so N scenes render on N
  GPUs and a batch takes as long as its slowest scene instead of the sum of all
  of them, at the same total cost (per-GPU-second billing). It MUST NOT exceed
  the provider's own ceiling — on Modal that is ``max_containers`` in
  modal-service/longcat-avatar/app.py — or the surplus jobs just queue at the
  provider while holding a `running` row here. Set it to 1 for sequential renders.

  matte (``AVATAR_MATTE_CONCURRENCY``, default 1) is LOCAL-CPU-BOUND. No
  provider is involved at all: it is rembg running in this process's executor
  pool, so the only constraint is cores on this machine. Cutouts contend rather
  than parallelise — see config.py for the measurements behind the default of 1.

A queued job of one kind can therefore never consume the other kind's slot, and
an empty queue of one kind never stops the other from dispatching.

This is correct only because the app runs `--workers 1` (see main.py's boot
comment) — a single process is the only writer transitioning queued -> running,
so no distributed lock is needed.

RETRY POLICY
``generate_scene_avatar_sync`` (render) returns an ``AvatarRenderError`` with a
``retryable`` flag. ``matte_scene_avatar_sync`` (matte) returns a bare string;
matte failures are local ffmpeg/subprocess/file issues rather than a remote
GPU service, so they are classified with a small heuristic here instead of
threading a new return type through avatar_matte.py. Either way, a job that
exhausts its retryable attempts is left `failed` with `retryable` persisted,
so the UI can decide whether to offer/auto-run a retry.

The attempt ceiling is PER SCENE, not per job row. Retries happen in-place here
(the row stays `running` and holds its concurrency slot) so a transient failure
never costs the scene its queue position — but the bulk retry endpoint creates
a NEW row, so the count is carried forward via ``attempt_count`` and this loop
resumes the tally rather than restarting it. That bounds an unattended retry
loop at ``AVATAR_MAX_ATTEMPTS`` renders per scene no matter how many times the
endpoint is called. An explicit per-scene Generate click resets the count (see
routers/projects.py), because a human asking again should never be refused.

    never render has been paid for and produced nothing.

    "For good" is two cases, and both matter:
      - attempts exhausted: burned the whole budget against, say, an outage;
      - retryable=False: died on the first attempt with a terminal error (no

    ``avatar_matte_failed_at`` is the backoff, and it is the reason this helper

    exactly ONE attempt there, because its failures are deterministic (a bad
    frame, a codec, an ffmpeg crash) rather than transient. Selecting purely on
    ``avatar_matte_path IS NULL`` therefore meant a scene that fails matting is
    re-enqueued every single time any other render in the project completes — an
    unbounded retry loop burning a queue slot and CPU to fail identically.

    Deliberately NOT applied to the single-scene ``/avatar-matte`` endpoint: that
    one is a human explicitly asking again, and must always be allowed. It clears

    WHY HERE AND NOT IN THE BROWSER
    The cutout is what makes a chosen background VISIBLE — without it the render
    pipeline falls back to the plain mp4 and the user's choice silently does
    nothing. Driving it from the client meant it only ran while the Avatar tab
    happened to be open on a settled batch: switch tabs, close the laptop, or
    just reload at the wrong moment and the work was never queued, leaving a
    "Remove them now" button to press by hand. Queued here it is part of the
    job's own lifecycle — it survives navigation, reloads and a closed browser.

    WHY IT WAITS FOR EVERY RENDER
    Deliberately NOT per-scene. Queueing each scene's cutout the moment its own
    render finished let mattes run ALONGSIDE the remaining renders, so a project
    could hold ~5 concurrent jobs' worth of DB connections at once. That drained
    the pool (size 5 + 10 overflow) and a still-rendering scene then failed to
    save its result — a clip that had already been paid for on the GPU was
    recorded as a failed attempt. Renders and cutouts therefore stay in strict
    phases, exactly as they were before this chaining existed.

    Does nothing when no cutout is wanted — avatar_bg NULL at both levels, or the
    explicit "original" — which is the case where the presenter keeps their
    filmed room and there is nothing to cut out.

    Takes the CALLER's session and does not commit — it is part of the same
    transaction that marks the render complete, so it adds no connection of its
    own to an already-contended pool.

    Never raises — a scene that renders fine must not be marked failed because

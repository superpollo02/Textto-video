# transform) accepts it; esbuild's BUNDLER accepts it too, because an
# unresolved identifier is assumed to be a runtime global; and no regex
# contract here is looking for it. At runtime the sandbox binds only an
# explicit allowlist as function parameters, so `frame0` is a genuine free
# variable and throws ReferenceError on the first frame — blanking the scene in
# the preview AND the export, since both evaluate the same stored code.
#
# The Level-2 runtime harness does catch this, but it cannot be relied on for
# it: it runs LAST (only when every static gate has passed) and it fails open
# when its toolchain is absent — which it was in production. So a scene with

    WHY THIS IS A HARD GATE. Without `containerWidth`, FitText falls back to
    `width * widthFraction` — 0.86 of the FULL 1920px canvas — so a headline in
    a 44% column is sized as if it owned the frame. Its own docstring calls this
    "a ~2x overestimate, and the direct cause of headlines breaking mid-word
    inside narrow columns". Measured on stored template 184: NOT ONE of its 9
    scenes passed containerWidth, and 8 of 9 passed no maxHeight either.

    The effect is both reported symptoms at once. Too large: the width solve
    resolves to the grow-ceiling for all but the longest copy, so a designed
    76px headline renders at 95-122px. Too small: where a scene does bound its
    box, the inflated seed drives the fitter down to its floor.

    The kit cannot fix this on its own — only the scene knows whether its text
    sits in a half-width split, a 40% rail or the full frame. So the geometry
    has to be demanded here, and taught in the prompt.

    A SPREAD COUNTS. `<FitText {...fitProps}>` where `fitProps` carries
    containerWidth is correct code, and hoisting repeated props into one object
    is the obvious thing to do in a `.map()` — the prompt even tells scenes to
    derive the width once from useVideoConfig(). Reading only the literal
    attribute text made that unsatisfiable: the model complies semantically,
    the regex still says no, and the message never hints that the LEXICAL form
    is what is being judged. So a spread whose object provably contains

    theme: the brand's colours, used to resolve `palette.<slot>` references to

    literal hex pairs, which is the conservative default for callers that do not

        """The prop plus every local name it flows into.

        Matching `props.quote` LITERALLY inside a fitter made this gate
        impossible to satisfy for code the prompt itself asks for. The contract
        says to write fallbacks ("If props.bullets / props.steps / props.metrics
        is empty or undefined: fall back to..."), and a fallback is naturally
        hoisted:

            const quoteText = props.quote ?? props.displayText;
            <FitText>{quoteText}</FitText>

        which is correct, fitted code the old check reported as a bare
        fontSize. The model then rewrote until its attempts ran out — one
        observed scene burned three rollouts (198s) on a rule it could not
        satisfy, and the same message repeated on every retry.

        Two hops, because splitting for a per-word animation is one more:
            const q = props.quote;  const words = q.split(" ");

        The same reasoning covers `.map()` callback parameters, which is how
        every ARRAY prop is actually rendered:

            {(props.metrics ?? []).slice(0, 4).map((m, i) => (
               <FitText fontSize={numeralSize}>{m.value}</FitText>
            ))}

        The fitter block contains `m`, never `metrics`, so following only
        `const` assignments made this unsatisfiable for metrics scenes — the
        identical failure this docstring already describes, one level down.

        Chased to a FIXED POINT, not a fixed number of hops.

        Two hops was not enough, and the shape that broke it is one this prompt
        ASKS FOR. The content contract tells a scene to stay presentable when
        its array is empty ("fall back to props.displayText rather than
        rendering nothing"), which every metrics scene implements as a second
        alias:

            const items    = (props.metrics ?? []).slice(0, 4);   // hop 1
            const fallback = items.length === 0 ? … : items;       // hop 2
            {fallback.map((m, i) => <FitText>{m.value}</FitText>)} // hop 3

        Three hops to reach `m`, and the loop stopped at two — so a scene that
        HAD wrapped its numerals was told to wrap them, three times, and the
        rollouts ran out. Template 199, scene 1: three repairs, all identical.

        The `.map` pass also used an `_alt` computed BEFORE the `const` pass in
        the same iteration, so a name learned from an assignment could not bind
        a callback parameter until the following hop — spending two hops to
        travel one. Recomputing between the passes is what makes each iteration
        worth a full step.

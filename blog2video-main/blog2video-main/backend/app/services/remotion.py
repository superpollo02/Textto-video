    WHY THIS EXISTS AS A SEPARATE, EARLY PASS
    -----------------------------------------
    This resolution used to happen ~800 lines into write_remotion_data, while the
    IMAGE CASCADE that depends on it runs near the top. On a project's first
    generation the pipeline writes descriptors carrying only
    ``{"structuredContent": ..., "layoutConfig": {}}`` — no scene type, no
    variant index — so `_custom_layout_id` returned None and EVERY scene fell
    through to the fallback layout (``content_0``).

    When that one layout happened to be image-free, the cascade concluded the
    whole video was image-free: it stripped every ``assignedVideo``, popped
    every ``assignedImage``, and persisted ``hideImage: True``. The later block
    then computed the correct variants — too late to matter, and the persisted
    hideImage meant it never healed. That is the "images and clips are assigned
    during generation, then cleaned at the end" bug.

    Resolving here, before any asset decision, is what makes the cascade see the
    real per-scene layouts on the FIRST run.

    Returns one dict per scene, in order. Non-custom templates get an empty list
    — every caller must treat that as "no opinion" and keep prior behaviour.

    Two corrections, both compensating for the same thing: the scene is

    not read it at all.

      * DROP entries the user disabled (`showWebsiteButton: False`) — no
        generated outro reads that flag.
      * ADD read-alias keys for the label/link, in case the scene guessed
        `label`/`text`/`link` instead of the canonical names.

    The documented/written contract is `ctaButtonText` + `websiteLink`
    (SceneEditModal.tsx writes exactly these, per `custom_prompt_builder.py`'s
    ending-scene contract in the codegen prompt). A generated component is
    still free-text JS an LLM wrote from that prompt, and at least one
    template (custom_201's outro, project 1211 scene 9) read
    `c.label ?? c.text` / `c.link ?? c.websiteLink` instead — neither `label`
    nor `text` exists on the real objects, so every CTA button rendered with
    an empty title while its (correctly-read) `websiteLink` line stayed
    visible beneath an unlabeled box, reading as an empty outline with
    orphaned URL text next to it.
    A rewritten component would fix this, but that requires the
    template-owner to regenerate and re-review the scene (see the ending
    contract's spacing/nesting rules in code_generator.py). Aliasing the keys
    here fixes every already-generated template immediately, at the one place

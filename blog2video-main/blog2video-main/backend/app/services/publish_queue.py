"""System-wide FIFO queue for social publish (upload) jobs.

THE MODEL
``social_publish_jobs`` rows with status="queued" ARE the queue, ordered by
(created_at, id) across every project and user. A single in-process asyncio
dispatcher claims the oldest queued row and runs it, up to
``SOCIAL_PUBLISH_CONCURRENCY`` at a time. Same shape as avatar_queue, and
correct for the same reason: the app runs ``--workers 1`` (see main.py's boot
comment), so one process is the only writer moving queued -> running and a plain
conditional UPDATE is already race-free.

A queue rather than a bare thread because an upload runs for minutes, has to
survive a restart mid-flight, has to be rate-limited app-wide against YouTube's
daily bucket, and has to stay pollable by a client that reconnects later.

Like avatar_queue and unlike the project-level jobs, this is deliberately NOT
part of the one-job-per-project lock in ``_assert_no_active_job``. An upload
reads a finished MP4 and mutates no project state, so making a re-render wait
behind one would cost the user time and buy nothing.

THE PENDING_RENDER HANDOFF
A job created before its video exists sits in ``pending_render`` until the
render-completion hook promotes it (see ``promote_pending_jobs_sync``, called
from remotion.upload_rendered_video_to_r2). That hook runs on the render's
daemon thread, which has no event loop — hence ``wake_threadsafe``. The
promotion is a plain DB write, so a missed wake only delays the upload until the
next tick or the next boot sweep; it can never lose the job.

RETRY POLICY
``PublishError.retryable`` decides. Retries happen in-place (the row stays
`running` and holds its slot) so a transient failure does not cost the job its
queue position, bounded by ``MAX_ATTEMPTS`` on the row. Non-retryable codes —
reauth_required, video_superseded, session_expired — fail immediately, because
retrying them would only burn the daily upload quota to fail the same way.

QUOTA
YouTube bills videos.insert to a bucket of ~100 uploads/day that is APP-WIDE,
not per user. When the local cap is reached the dispatcher simply stops claiming
YouTube jobs; they stay `queued` and go out as the 24h window rolls. Failing
them instead would throw away the user's intent over something that self-heals.

"""Cut the presenter out of an already-rendered avatar clip.

WHY THIS EXISTS
The roster portraits are ordinary photographs — real rooms, brick walls, shelves
(see avatar_presets.py). The render service animates the whole frame, so the mp4
it returns has that room baked into every pixel. There is no alpha channel and
nothing chroma-keyable, so showing the presenter over a colour of the user's
choosing means literally segmenting them out of the footage.

WHY IT RUNS HERE AND NOT IN THE SPACE
Matting could live in the render service's Space, next to the GPU. It deliberately
does not:
  - the Space was deployed by OVERWRITING avtr1-service (new Docker Spaces are
    402-paywalled), so every redeploy is a risk we take only when forced;
  - matting there would occupy the L40S with work that is not generation;
  - and crucially, running it here lets us matte an EXISTING clip. Changing the
    background costs ~1 min of CPU instead of a ~3.5 min re-render, and makes no
    Space call at all.

WHEN IT RUNS — THIS IS NOW THE FALLBACK PATH, NOT THE MAIN ONE
Matting normally happens INSIDE the Modal render container, so /render returns the
mp4 and both transparent twins in one call and a scene's cutout exists the moment
its render lands (see modal-service/longcat-avatar/app.py's _matte_mp4, which is a port
of the pipeline below — keep the two in sync).

This module still runs, as a SceneAvatarJob(kind="matte"), for the cases inline
matting cannot cover:
  - clips rendered BEFORE inline matting existed;
  - AVATAR_INLINE_MATTE turned off;
  - a scene whose inline matte failed (Scene.avatar_matte_error records why — the
    inline matte gets exactly one attempt, because its failures are deterministic);
  - a deliberate re-matte, e.g. after changing the model.

Because it runs in the API process it is still the one thing here that can OOM the
server (see _peak_rss_mb), which is why AVATAR_MATTE_CONCURRENCY stays at 1. That
is now a rare path rather than the routine one.

The mp4 is READ, never modified: TWO transparent twins are written beside it (see
step 3 below for why there are two), so the original always survives for re-matting
or fallback.

Cost is paid once per scene. Once a scene has a matte, further colour changes are a
CSS repaint in the overlay — no job at all.

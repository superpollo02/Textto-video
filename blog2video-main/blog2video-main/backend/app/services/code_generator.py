class GenerateSceneCode(dspy.Signature):
    """Generate a single Remotion video scene as a React component.

    Write a component assigned to `const SceneComponent`. No imports — every API
    below is already a global.

    ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
    THE TEN RULES. Every one is machine-checked; breaking any is an automatic
    reject and a wasted rebuild. Satisfy all ten FIRST, then design.

     1. TITLE AND DISPLAY TEXT — every scene renders BOTH, at the two different
        sizes rule 7 defines. Copy these shapes exactly:
            const { width, height } = useVideoConfig();
            const colW = width * (isPortrait ? 0.86 : 0.44);  // THIS text's box
            ...
            <FitText fontSize={titleSize} minFontSize={24} maxLines={2}
              containerWidth={colW} maxHeight={height*0.40}>{props.sceneTitle}</FitText>
            <FitText fontSize={bodySize} minFontSize={20} maxLines={4}
              containerWidth={colW} maxHeight={height*0.26}>{props.displayText}</FitText>
        `titleSize` is props.titleFontSize (the TITLE only); `bodySize` is
        props.descriptionFontSize (everything else) — both from rule 7. Never a
        bare number here, never another default, and NEVER `titleSize` on the
        display text: it is body copy, not a headline.
        THE TITLE ALWAYS GETS THE TALLER BOX: FitText shrinks to its maxHeight,
        so a title budgeted under the body renders smaller.
        Never put whiteSpace:'nowrap' on a FitText: it voids maxLines.
     2. FIT EVERY VARIABLE-LENGTH TEXT. props.quote and props.metrics values are
        checked too. Any text whose length you do not control gets <FitText>.
        EVERY <FitText> MUST BE TOLD ITS BOX — this is checked on each one:
          containerWidth = the REAL width in px of the box the text sits in,
            from useVideoConfig().width times your layout's fraction: a
            half-split ~0.44, a full-bleed line 0.86, a 40% rail 0.4. Without it
            FitText assumes 86% of the WHOLE frame — a ~2x overestimate inside a
            column, so text renders far too big and breaks mid-word.
          maxHeight = the height that text block actually owns, for anything
            that can wrap (maxLines > 1). Without it there is no vertical
            budget and long copy overflows downward off the frame.
        Never guess these as bare pixel numbers — always derive them from
        useVideoConfig() so they hold in BOTH orientations.
     3. MOTION — at least TWO interpolate()/spring() calls driving visible
        motion. interpolate ranges are NUMBERS ONLY (never '0%'); spring's
        from/to are NUMBERS, never objects.
     4. LOGO — on EVERY scene, guarded exactly like this:
            {props.logoUrl && typeof props.logoUrl === 'string' && (
              <Img src={props.logoUrl} data-logo="1" style={{width: 190, height: 'auto',
                   maxHeight: 190, objectFit: 'contain'}} />
            )}
        Required and checked, but props.logoUrl is undefined on every scene:
        the real brand mark is a corner watermark the render path composites
        over the finished frame. Never build a layout around it, and keep the
        bottom-right corner clear.
     5. IMAGE — do exactly what `scene_doc` says and nothing else.
        Its IMAGE section names one of three, and there is no fourth:
          BACKGROUND — full frame, rendered FIRST at zIndex 0, content above at
            zIndex 1 with position:'relative', and a BACKDROP OVERLAY between
            them. A full-bleed slot written AFTER the content paints over the
            layout and is rejected.
            The overlay is ALWAYS derived from the brand canvas — a gradient or
            wash built with withAlpha(bg, …), e.g.
                background: `linear-gradient(180deg, ${withAlpha(bg, 0.25)} 0%,
                             ${withAlpha(bg, 0.65)} 62%, ${withAlpha(bg, 0.88)} 100%)`
            NEVER a black or white wash and never a raw rgba() literal: a black
            scrim on a cream brand reads as a different template. Darken the
            overlay, never the <Img> — the photo stays fully opaque
            (objectFit:'cover', no opacity reduction).
          HALF — a BOUNDED box: 50% width x 100% height landscape, 100% x 50%
            portrait, on the side named. It is a normal flex/grid child. Never
            position:'absolute', never inset:0, never full-bleed — those make it
            a BACKGROUND, which is a different mode and is rejected here.
          NONE — declare no hasImage, render no props.imageUrl, reserve no slot.
        When there IS an image:
            const hasImage = !!(props.imageUrl && typeof props.imageUrl === 'string');
        and put data-content-img="1" on the slot's CONTAINER div, never on <Img>.
     6. COLOUR — three roles, read once at the top, and NEVER a hex literal for
        anything you draw:
            const bg = props.brandColors.background;
            const text = props.brandColors.text;
            const accent = props.brandColors.accent;
        BACKGROUND — the root fill is always `bg` (or the brand gradient when
          props.brandColors.bg2 exists). Never repaint the whole frame another
          colour: every scene shares one canvas, or the background changes as
          the viewer scrubs.
        TEXT — `text` is the colour of TYPE. EVERY string you paint uses it:
          headline, body, bullets, labels, captions, numerals, and anything from
          props.layoutProps. A kicker you invented is still text. On any surface
          that is not `bg`, use readableOn(thatSurface) so the type still clears
          4.5:1 against what is behind it.
        ACCENT — `accent` is for FILLS and SHAPES ONLY: rules, underlines,
          markers, borders, bars, dots, panel edges, icon strokes. It is NOT
          contrast-corrected, so using it AS TYPE is how the most important
          number on a frame becomes the least readable thing on it. For
          accent-coloured type: color: ensureContrast(accent, bg).
        Never introduce a fourth hue — withAlpha() gives you the same hue
        softer, and that is the right move for a tint, a scrim or a muted label.
        HARD GATE, and the most common rejection: colours named in the
        brand_context or a doc ("vivid blue cards") describe the brand's
        WEBSITE, not your palette. There are three. Use withAlpha(accent, …)
        where you wanted a second hue.
     7. TYPE SIZE — THERE ARE EXACTLY TWO SIZES ON THE FRAME AND NO THIRD.
        Both defaults are CHECKED NUMERICALLY. Write them once, at the top:
            const titleSize = props.titleFontSize ?? (isPortrait ? 48 : 68);
            const bodySize  = props.descriptionFontSize ?? (isPortrait ? 30 : 34);
        titleSize sizes props.sceneTitle and NOTHING ELSE. bodySize sizes
        EVERYTHING else: the display text, every content prop, and every label,
        caption, kicker and props.layoutProps string.

        props.sceneTitle IS NOT AN EYEBROW. Sizing it off bodySize is REJECTED —
        it puts the title at body scale and the Title slider then moves nothing.
        A small kicker above it is a SEPARATE string, from props.layoutProps.

        Four things are enforced:
          a. BOTH read their prop with ??. A hardcoded size makes the editor's
             sliders do nothing.
          b. BOTH defaults are `isPortrait ? P : L` ternaries, never one flat
             number.
          c. title > body in BOTH orientations. Aim ~2.2x landscape, ~1.7x
             portrait.
          d. Every default sits inside its band, INCLUSIVE:
                 title  landscape 48-88   portrait 36-60
                 body   landscape 28-44   portrait 26-38
             PORTRAIT IS SMALLER THAN LANDSCAPE HERE — the opposite of the
             usual convention, and the most common reason a scene is rejected.

        THERE IS NO props.sceneTitleFontSize — reading it is rejected, and a
        third constant is a slider the editor does not have. Every other size is
        a RATIO of `titleSize` or `bodySize` (a small label is bodySize * 0.8),
        never a second literal. Nothing below 22px: this is a 1920x1080 video
        watched across a room and crushed by H.264.
        WRAP THE TEXT REGION IN <FitBlock> so title and body shrink TOGETHER
        when the pair overflows:
            <FitBlock style={{display:'flex', flexDirection:'column', gap: 18}}>
              <FitText fontSize={titleSize} minFontSize={24} maxLines={2}>…</FitText>
              <div style={{fontSize: bodySize}}>…</div>
            </FitBlock>
        A <FitText> fits its OWN box; only <FitBlock> sees that a title and a
        paragraph each fit while the pair overflows the column.
     8. FONTS — there are exactly TWO font props and no others:
            fontFamily: props.headingFont || "inherit"   // headings, display type
            fontFamily: props.bodyFont || "inherit"      // body, labels, captions
        The fallback is the literal "inherit", NEVER a font name. Any scene that
        renders body copy must bind props.bodyFont somewhere — a scene whose
        headings use the template's face while its body falls back to the system
        sans reads as two different designs.
        THERE IS NO MONO FONT PROP. For code, tickers, tabular figures or any
        other monospaced treatment, write the GENERIC family only:
            fontFamily: 'monospace'
        Never a named face — 'Geist Mono', 'JetBrains Mono', 'SF Mono' and the
        like are not loaded by the renderer, so they silently fall back to the
        system sans and the scene loses the exact distinction it asked for.
     9. ORIENTATION — declare it and branch on it:
            const isPortrait = props.aspectRatio === 'portrait';
        Render genuinely different JSX per orientation, not one tree with tweaked
        numbers. Any list/grid MUST branch. Cap every mapped array:
            (props.bullets ?? []).slice(0, isPortrait ? 3 : 4)
    10. NEVER — props.narrationText on screen (it is the voiceover);
        props.contentType as visible text; scene counters ("01 / 09"); invented
        sample copy or fallback arrays of fake data; overflow other than
        overflow:'hidden' on the root; any pre-injected name beyond FitText,
        FitBlock, readableOn, ensureContrast, withAlpha (and SocialIcons in the
        ending).
    ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

    DESIGN FROM `scene_doc`. It describes THIS scene's layout, focal element,
    type treatment and motion beat, in both orientations. Build what it says —
    it was written for this brand. `general_doc` is the shared identity every
    scene inherits; `built_so_far` lists the other scenes, and yours must be a
    different composition from all of them.

    CRAFT — the measured defaults of this product's hand-built templates. Use
    them unless `scene_doc` says otherwise; it owns composition, these own craft.
      SAFE AREA   horizontal inset 6-8%; vertical 12-14% portrait / 5-7%
                  landscape. Content occupies 0.46-0.78 of the frame, never 1.0.
      TYPE        rule 7 owns the numbers and the two-tier rule. A hero NUMERAL
                  (a single stat, not the title) may go to 240.
      TRACKING    title -0.01 to -0.05em; small caps labels +0.06 to +0.2em.
      LEADING     title 1.0-1.15; body 1.3-1.5; numerals 0.95-1.05.
      WEIGHT      title 900; body 300-400; label 600-700.
      MOTION      spring {damping:20, stiffness:80} default;
                  {damping:16, stiffness:210, mass:1.2} for a slam.
                  Entrances: primary at frame 0-3, secondary +10, tertiary +25;
                  fades 12-20 frames; stagger i*3 (dense) or i*8 (cards).
                  EXIT at durationInFrames - 25, over 12-20 frames.
      SCRIM       3 stops, 180deg, inflection at 62%:
                  0.25 @0% -> 0.08 @30% -> 0.65 @62% -> 0.88 @100%.
      CAPS        metrics 3 · stack 3 · stats 4 · timeline 5 · code 12 lines.
      OVERFLOW    every flex child holding text sets minWidth: 0; running text
                  sets overflowWrap:'break-word'; fixed-size decals flexShrink:0.

    PROPS the scene receives:
      sceneTitle       THE SCENE'S TITLE, 5-7 words — its main label and the
                       LARGEST TYPE on the frame. Always rendered, at titleSize.
      displayText      supporting copy, 1-2 sentences. Always rendered, at
                       bodySize, alongside the content prop and the image.

                       Every string this scene invents (kicker, panel label,
                       caption, footnote) is read as
                         props.layoutProps?.kicker ?? "KEY POINTS"
                       never inlined — a literal is frozen forever. camelCase,
                       naming MEANING not styling. A key you declare but never
                       read this way is dropped.
      ctaProps?        ENDING SCENE ONLY — see the ending contract in scene_doc

    CONTENT ARRAYS: when props.bullets / steps / metrics / timelineItems is
    present, render each item as its OWN row or cell — never one paragraph —
    staggered by i*12 frames. When absent, split props.displayText into
    sentences, or render it as one item. NEVER invent example data, and
    never write `props.bullets || [{...}]`.

    STOCK FOOTAGE (props.hasVideo): a clip is already painted behind the
    component. Keep the image slot's geometry and its data-content-img="1"
    marker, leave it EMPTY (no <Img>, no backgroundColor, no nested
    gradient div), and make the root transparent. props.imageUrl is absent
    here and in every template preview: never render the hasImage-false
    full-width branch, which has nowhere for the clip, and never read
    THROUGH it (.split/.endsWith/new URL) unguarded — that crashes it.

# The bar an attempt must clear to be accepted without a retry. Deliberately
# generous: the checks below are quality NUDGES, and each costs a full extra LLM
# call when it forces a re-roll. At the old 0.75 any TWO -0.15 nudges (e.g. "no
# overflow guard" + "does not branch on isPortrait", both common on blueprint
# templates) sank an otherwise VALID scene to 0.70 and bought another rollout for
# cosmetic reasons. 0.6 still forces a retry on the genuinely bad combinations
# (hardcoded data -0.3 + contentType leak -0.2 = 0.5) while letting valid,
# slightly-imperfect scenes through.

# The code critic's band: scenes scoring at or above this are trusted, and
# anything below it (but at or above REFINE_THRESHOLD) is good enough to ship yet
# carries at least one soft defect worth a second opinion.
#
# It sits above 0.85 deliberately. Every design-adherence miss is worth exactly
# -0.15, so a scene whose ONLY defect was ignoring its scene doc scored 0.85; a
# gate at `score < 0.85` meant precisely those were never reviewed. 0.9 keeps
# them in scope while skipping a scene whose only flaw is a -0.1 (no tonal
# depth, an uncapped list map) — not worth a full extra rollout.
#
# This is now the only second-opinion pass. A vision check that rendered each
# suspect scene and critiqued the pixels used to sit alongside it in the 0.6-0.85
# band; it shipped dark, was never enabled, and was removed along with its shot
# server. The critics that remain read code, not pixels — see scene_code_critic

# defects that need the component actually run.

    # sees a Typography control with nothing on the frame responding to it.
    #
    # SOFT rather than a validator gate, for the reason recorded in
    # code_validator above _renders_headline: the model cannot add a title to a
    # design with no place for one, so a hard gate exhausts three repairs and
    # stubs the scene. -0.3 is heavy enough to sink an otherwise-average attempt
    # below the 0.6 acceptance bar while still letting an excellent scene
    # through, which is what makes the refine loop prefer a compliant attempt.
    #
    # Detection mirrors _renders_headline in the validator: fire only when
    # sceneTitle is NOT interpolated into the tree. A data-only read
    # (`const label = props.sceneTitle || props.displayText`) does not count as
    # rendering it.
    #
    # THE ALIAS PATTERN MUST TOLERATE A WRAPPED INITIALISER. This matched only
    # `= props.sceneTitle` with the prop immediately after the `=`, which the
    # bookend contracts' own prescribed idiom does not satisfy:
    #
    #     const title = (props.sceneTitle || '').trim();
    #
    # The leading paren defeated the match, so the alias went undetected and a
    # scene that followed the contract exactly was charged -0.3 for "never
    # renders props.sceneTitle" — a false positive on the very code this prompt
    # asks for, costing real rollouts. Scan the whole initialiser instead, and
    # collect EVERY alias rather than the first: a scene routinely declares the
    # title and the display text together, and the title is not always first.

    # The second renders the display text and merely falls back to the title, so

         a red brand.

    heuristic passed #FFFFFF on #B4B4B4 (delta 0.29) which is 1.9:1 — badly
    unreadable.

    """Stop `dspy.Refine` spending an LLM call to GUESS at an error we already have.

    Between every pair of rollouts Refine calls
    `dspy.Predict(OfferFeedback)(...)` — handing the model the program source
    and the full trajectory so it can *infer* why the last attempt scored
    badly. The call is inline in `Refine.forward` with no flag and no
    overridable method, so this patch is the only seam.

    Here that inference is pure waste: `_scene_reward` has already written the
    REAL validator output (every failed contract, numbered, with an annotated
    source window) into `previous_failure`, which the next rollout reads
    directly. Refine would spend a call rediscovering a diagnostic we are
    holding — which is exactly what made the earlier hand-rolled loop faster.
    Suppressing it is what lets REFINE_N rise to 5 attempts at the same cost 3
    attempts used to carry: 5 LLM calls per failing scene, not 9.

    HOW: Refine consumes the result as `if not advice:` and takes the plain
    (unwrapped) path when it is falsy — so a stub whose `.advice` is None makes
    the next rollout run normally with no `hint_` field appended. The stub must
    RETURN falsy rather than raise: an exception here is swallowed by Refine's
    own `except`, which decrements `fail_count` and burns a rollout (measured:
    4 generations instead of 5).

    SAFETY: the patch is process-wide while active and scenes run
    concurrently, so it must never intercept a sibling's real predictor. The
    `sig is refine_mod.OfferFeedback` identity check is what guarantees that —
    every other signature is delegated to the real `dspy.Predict`.

# How many scenes may be in flight AT ONCE — a ROLLING window, not a wave.
#
# Scenes are fully independent (each has its own design doc and prompt, and
# nothing about one depends on another finishing), so this cap is about the
# PROVIDER, not correctness.
#
# THE WINDOW SLIDES. Every scene's task is created upfront and blocks on the
# semaphore; the instant one finishes it releases its slot and the next waiting
# scene starts. An 11-scene template at 8 does NOT run "8 then 3" — it keeps 8
# in flight until fewer than 8 remain. Both stages that fan out work this way:
# generation (as_completed over pre-created tasks) and the verify/repair pass
# (asyncio.gather over all scenes, same semaphore size). Sizing this to
# MAX_SCENES therefore buys nothing over a smaller window except a bigger
# opening burst, which is exactly what throttles.
#
# Why not larger: 429s appeared at 11 on Z.AI's glm-5.3, and a rate-limited
# rollout is charged to dspy.Refine as a FAILED ATTEMPT — so a throttled burst
# can silently eat a scene's whole rollout budget and push it into the repair
# loop for reasons unrelated to its code.
#
# Why this is no longer the real ceiling: a scene is not one request. Each also
# runs _describe_scene_props on a second LM, and repairs add more. The hard
# bound on simultaneous provider calls is _PROVIDER_MAX_INFLIGHT in
# app.dspy_modules, enforced on the LM itself so every caller queues against
# one gate. THAT is the knob to turn if 429s persist — not this one, which now
# governs how many scenes are queued rather than how much load is applied.

# ─── Image contract ─────────────────────────────────────────────

# A scene carries an image in exactly ONE of two forms. Both are here rather
# than left to the model because they are the only two that stay readable at
# every copy length: an inset or a collage looks fine against the sample text
# and breaks on a real headline, and a background with no scrim buries the copy
# under the photo.

        "    written after the content hides the entire layout behind a bare photo.\n"

    of editing the current code. That distinction matters for a STUBBED scene:
    its stored code is a generic placeholder the generator fell back to, so

    exactly what the signature's "empty when generating fresh" contract expects.

    Deliberately does NOT fall back to the stub. Everywhere else a stub is the
    right answer — a degraded scene beats a dead batch. Here it would silently
    replace the user's scene with a generic one after they asked for a specific
    change, so a failed edit is reported as a failure and the published scene is

"""Per-scene talking-head avatar rendering.

Avatars are ON DEMAND and PER SCENE: the user opens the Scene Edit modal, picks a
presenter and hits Generate, which starts a SceneAvatarJob. That job calls
``generate_scene_avatar_sync`` here, which renders a lip-synced clip from THAT
scene's voiceover mp3 via the LongCat service on Modal serverless GPU
(modal-service/longcat-avatar/ — it replaced a HuggingFace Space on 2026-08-02; the
HF Space in this project now only HOSTS THE BACKEND and runs no avatar work), saves it
to R2, and records it on the scene (avatar_video_path) + an AssetType.AVATAR row.
The Remotion composition overlays the clip (see remotion.py emit and AvatarOverlay).

Design:
  - `requests` (already a dependency) is used rather than an async client so this
    needs no new package. The render is a long, blocking HTTP call (~2.6 min), so
    the caller must run it off the event loop.
  - A DB session is NEVER held across the render — Neon drops idle SSL
    connections, so inputs are read in one short-lived session and the results
    written in a fresh one (see _read_scene_render_inputs / _persist_render_result).
  - Failures return a human-readable reason rather than raising, so the job can
    surface it to the user. A scene with no clip simply plays with no overlay.

The reference portrait is chosen by preset id (Scene.avatar_preset), and the render
is a SINGLE request:

  - roster preset: the portrait bytes are bundled inside the service image, so we
    send only the preset id and it self-stages the file. See avatar_presets.py.
  - custom: the service has never seen the user's photo, so its bytes are uploaded
    as part of the same /render call.

There is no separate /prepare step. There used to be, and it was the source of a
whole class of failures: it staged the photo on container-local disk, but the
service scales to zero ~2s after idle, so /prepare and /render routinely landed on
different containers and the second found nothing.

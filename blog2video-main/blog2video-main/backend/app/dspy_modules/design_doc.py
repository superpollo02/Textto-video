"""Design documents — the template's design, authored in prose before any code.

WHY THIS REPLACED THE BLUEPRINT
-------------------------------
The blueprint stage this supersedes tried to solve template sameness by giving
the model a richer vocabulary to pick from: 9 eras, 19 decor systems, 25
artifact motions, per-content-type layout variants, bookend arrangements. All of
it was rendered into the prompt under the header

    "AVAILABLE KIT VOCABULARY — you MUST choose from these exact values."

That is the bug, not the fix. With a fixed menu, two brands differ by which
CELL of a fixed grid they land in — a permutation, not a design. The blueprint
then needed a bank of ~16 divergence constraints, a house-style score and a
reject-and-reroll loop to fight its own vocabulary, and templates still
converged.

This module removes the menu. The model is told it is the art director, that
nothing is pre-decided, and to invent the template's design. Divergence comes
from three places instead of from constraint machinery:

  1. `brand_description` — a narrative design brief, not a colour list.
  2. Temperature 1.0 with nothing pulling toward a shared vocabulary.
  3. Per-scene documents, so each scene is designed on its own terms.

WHAT SURVIVES VALIDATION
------------------------
Only render-correctness, never taste:

  * scene count clamped to [3, 12] and roles coerced BY POSITION (first=intro,
    last=outro) — so the bookends are structural, not something the model can
    forget;
  * `image_mode` restricted to "background" | "half" with a side, because those
    are the only two forms that stay readable at every copy length;
  * fonts/decor/surface/transitions snapped through render_registry, because a
    value outside those sets silently renders as the system default.

This stage can never fail generation: `fallback_design_docs()` synthesises a
usable doc set if the model fails twice.

    """Design a video template for this brand, from scratch.

    You are the art director. Nothing is pre-decided: there is no layout
    catalog, no component menu, no style preset, no list of eras or motifs to
    choose from. Invent this template's design.

    Produce a GENERAL doc — the template's shared identity: palette roles,
    typographic character, spatial system, motion personality, and the recurring
    visual thread that ties the scenes together. Every scene inherits it, and it
    is what makes the template read as one thing rather than a pile of slides.

    Then produce ONE doc PER SCENE — 9 to 12 scenes INCLUDING the opening and
    the ending. The FIRST scene is always the opening, the LAST always the
    ending.

    BETWEEN THEM, FIVE SCENES ARE REQUIRED. A blog post routinely contains all
    five kinds of content, and each needs a layout actually built for it —
    forcing a process into a layout designed for statistics is how a template
    starts looking generic:

      metrics     two to four figures with labels; the NUMBERS are the focal
                  element, set far larger than anything around them
      timeline    dated or sequential events, in order, with the progression
                  itself visible
      comparison  two things set against each other, given equal weight
      steps       an ordered process, numbered, read as a sequence
      dataviz     A PLOTTED CHART of tabular data — a line, bar or histogram
                  chart drawn from a table of figures. Design the FRAME around
                  the plot: where the title and its supporting line sit, what
                  rule or panel the plot sits on or within, where the caption
                  goes, and how much of the frame the plot itself occupies. The
                  chart IS the focal element, so give it the dominant area.
                  Do NOT design the chart's internals — you do not choose the
                  chart kind, the axes, the gridlines or the series colours: one
                  chart component draws all three kinds from the data and picks
                  the right one itself. Design everything AROUND it. This scene
                  never carries an image.

    Then add 2 to 5 MORE scenes of your own choosing — a quote, a list, a plain
    narrative beat, a code sample, whatever this brand's story actually needs.

    THESE ARE PURPOSES, NOT DESIGNS. Two templates' metrics scenes must look
    nothing alike: one a ruled ledger with figures on a baseline, another a
    single hero numeral with a side rail, another a quadrant. What is fixed is
    what the scene is FOR — never how it looks. Design each one from this
    brand's own identity, exactly as you would an unconstrained scene.

    Each scene doc must be COMPLETE enough to build the scene from alone:
    its visual description, its concrete layout geometry (where things sit, at
    what proportion, in BOTH landscape and portrait), its focal element, its
    typographic treatment, and its motion beat. Write it as instructions to
    someone who cannot see the other scenes.

    EVERY SCENE HAS THE SAME FOUR ZONES. Place all four in every doc — a scene
    that designs around only one of them cannot be built:

      1. THE TITLE (props.sceneTitle) — a 5 to 7 word line naming what this
         scene is about. It is the scene's MAIN LABEL and its LARGEST TYPE.
         Say where it sits and how it is treated.
      2. THE DISPLAY TEXT (props.displayText) — one or two short sentences of
         supporting copy, set at body scale beneath or beside the title.
      3. THE CONTENT PROPS — whatever this scene's content type carries
         (bullets, metrics, steps, a timeline, a quote, a comparison, code).
         Set at body scale, as their own rows or cells.
      4. THE IMAGE — only when this scene carries one; see IMAGES below.

    THERE ARE EXACTLY TWO TYPE SIZES ON A FRAME: the title's, and one body size
    shared by the display text, the content props, and every label, caption and
    marker. Do NOT design a third tier — no small tracked kicker above the
    title, no eyebrow, no chapter label sized independently. A scene needing a
    label should make it a label AT BODY SIZE. This is a hard constraint on the
    build, not a stylistic preference: there is no third size to give it.

    EVERY SCENE'S TITLE IS TREATED DIFFERENTLY. You can see the other scenes in
    this template; make each title's placement, alignment, and entrance its own
    — one flush left over a rule, one centred and large, one set against the
    image edge. Ten scenes whose titles all sit top-left in the same weight is
    one scene repeated ten times.

    IMAGES. Decide per scene whether it carries an image at all. A scene whose
    design is purely typographic SHOULD say no — a template where every scene
    demands a photo is a worse template. When a scene does carry one, it must
    use EXACTLY ONE of two forms, because these are the only two that stay
    readable at every copy length:

      "background" - the image fills the frame behind everything, always with an
                     overlay/scrim above it so the type stays legible. The image
                     itself stays opaque; readability comes from the scrim.
      "half"       - the image occupies exactly one half: left or right in
                     landscape, top or bottom in portrait. Say which.

    No insets, no floating image cards, no collages, no quarter-panels, no
    circular crops.

    THE FIRST SCENE IS THE VIDEO'S TITLE CARD, AND MUST READ AS AN OPENING.
    Its TITLE (props.sceneTitle) is the video's title, the single focal element,
    and the LARGEST TYPE IN THE TEMPLATE — set it at the very top of the size
    range, not at the size a content scene uses. The display text is a subtitle
    beneath it at body scale. An opening carries NO bullets, no metric grid, no
    timeline, no step list: a title card that arrives already full of data is
    not an opening, it is a content slide in the wrong position. Give the title
    real focal presence — this is the frame that establishes the whole video.

    BUT DO NOT DESIGN A BARE CENTRED TITLE. "No content props" is a rule about
    DATA, not a licence to leave the frame empty. A title and a subtitle floating
    in the middle of an empty canvas is the weakest opening you can draw, and it
    is what this instruction keeps producing when read too literally. The opening
    is the frame that sets the template's visual argument, so give it real
    COMPOSITION — built from geometry and the palette, never from content:

      * an asymmetric or offset placement — the title anchored to a third, set
        against an edge, or dropped low — instead of dead centre;
      * structural rules and bands — a heavy accent rule, a full-bleed colour
        block, a divider the title sits on or breaks through;
      * framing geometry — a corner bracket, an oversized numeral or letterform
        bled off the canvas, a grid of hairlines, a large soft shape behind the
        type;
      * depth from the palette — a two-tone split, a tonal band, a gradient
        wash — so the frame reads as designed rather than as default.

    Use the ones that suit the template's identity; two or three deliberate
    moves beat a pile of decoration. Every element here must come from the
    palette and the geometry you have already defined — no data, no icons
    standing in for information, and NO third type tier (the kicker rule above
    is absolute: a label goes at BODY size or not at all).

    THE LAST SCENE MUST READ AS AN ENDING. Its title is a sign-off, and the
    closing call-to-action buttons and social handles are supplied to it at
    render time — design a closing scene that HOSTS them inside its own layout,
    with real room reserved for a row of buttons and a row of handles. Like the
    opening it carries no content props: an ending is a close, not another data
    beat. Do not design a generic centred card, and do not omit space for the
    CTA and socials.

    THE BRAND LOGO IS NOT YOURS TO PLACE. It is a corner watermark the render
    path composites over every finished frame, at a size and position no scene
    controls. Never design a scene around a logo, and keep the bottom-right
    corner free of anything the watermark would sit on top of.

    THE SCENE LAYOUTS MUST BE INDEPENDENT DESIGNS. Not one geometry recoloured N
    times, and not variations on a theme — genuinely different compositions that
    happen to share an identity. Two scenes with the same skeleton is the
    failure mode to avoid. If two of your scenes could be described by the same
    sentence, redesign one of them.

    YOU ARE DESIGNING A 1920x1080 VIDEO FRAME (or 1080x1920 portrait) — NOT A
    WEB PAGE. It is watched from across a room and compressed to H.264. Type that
    reads fine in a UI is invisible here: 12px is a sixth of a percent of the
    frame height and does not survive the encoder. NOTHING SMALLER THAN 22px
    EVER APPEARS ON SCREEN. That is a floor, not a target:

        hero numeral   120-240px      headline        48-88px
        sub-head       40-64px        body copy       28-36px
        caption        24-30px        label / eyebrow 22-28px

    (Those are LANDSCAPE figures. Portrait is SMALLER, not larger — the canvas
    is 1080 wide against landscape's 1920, so the same point size eats nearly
    twice the line: headline 36-60px, body 26-38px there.)

    PREFER DESCRIBING TYPE BY ROLE AND RELATIVE WEIGHT — "a small monospace
    label, roughly a third the size of the value beside it" — over absolute
    pixels. The scene builder derives exact sizes from a scale, and a role reads
    correctly at any canvas size. Where you do name a number, take it from the
    ranges above.

    The same applies to every other measurement: spacing, rules and margins are a
    percentage of the frame or a multiple of the type size, not a UI-scale
    constant. A 1px hairline and a 4px gap disappear at this scale.

    COLOUR: name roles ("the brand accent", "the canvas colour", "the text
    colour at 60%"), not hex values. The scene builder binds those to the user's
    live palette, so a hex you invent here is a colour the user can never change
    — and two independently-chosen hexes are how a scene ends up dark-on-dark.
    Say what a colour IS FOR and let the palette supply it.

    THIS TEMPLATE HAS EXACTLY THREE COLOURS — accent, canvas, text — AND NO
    OTHERS. Do not name a hue at all: no "vivid blue category cards", no "deep
    navy panel", no "warm coral marker". Not a hex, not a colour word, not a
    secondary palette.

    The brief you are given DESCRIBES A WEBSITE, and websites carry secondary
    palettes this template does not have. A brief saying the brand uses "vivid
    blue, purple and deep navy category cards" is telling you what the brand
    looks like in a browser, NOT giving you colours to design with. Write that
    energy into the accent's ROLE and into the composition instead — more
    accent, bolder blocks, higher contrast.

    This is the single most expensive thing to get wrong here: the scene builder
    is HARD-GATED on the three palette colours, so a doc that asks for a blue
    card produces a scene that is rejected and rebuilt from scratch, every time,
    until the rollouts run out.

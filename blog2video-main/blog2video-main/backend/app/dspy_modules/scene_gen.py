# ─── Scene Descriptor Signature ──────────────────────────────

class SceneToDescriptor(dspy.Signature):
    """
    You are a professional video scene designer for an educational explainer video.
    Your job is to analyze the narration and create a visually engaging layout descriptor.

    ═══ YOUR GOAL ═══
    Create a DIVERSE, VISUALLY RICH video. You must:
    1. Pick the BEST layout type that makes the content visually compelling
    2. Extract REAL, structured data from the narration into the layout's specific props
    3. Ensure the video feels like a polished documentary — NOT a text slideshow

    ═══ VARIETY IS CRITICAL ═══
    A good explainer video uses a MIX of visual styles across its scenes.
    - NEVER use the same layout for more than 2 consecutive scenes
    - text_narration is the LEAST engaging layout — use it as an ABSOLUTE LAST RESORT
    - You should use text_narration for AT MOST 1 scene in the entire video (ideally zero)
    - A 7-scene video should ideally use 5-7 DIFFERENT layout types
    - Think like a filmmaker: alternate between data-heavy scenes (metric, code_block),
      visual scenes (image_caption, flow_diagram), and impact scenes (quote_callout, comparison)
    - The viewer should feel visual momentum — each scene should LOOK different from the last

    ═══ PREFER VISUAL LAYOUTS ═══
    Always try to express content as a VISUAL element rather than plain text:
    - Any process, workflow, or "how it works" → flow_diagram (even if not explicitly stated)
    - Any list of items, features, benefits → bullet_list (animated, numbered points)
    - Any before/after, pros/cons, two options → comparison (split-screen)
    - Any number, percentage, stat, or performance claim → metric (animated counter)
    - Any quote, definition, or key insight → quote_callout (accent bar + glow)
    - Any phases, timeline, or ordered events → timeline (vertical dots)
    - If the narration describes a system architecture, data pipeline, or multi-step process,
      ALWAYS use flow_diagram — decompose it into 3-5 short step labels
    - If the narration mentions benefits, features, or takeaways, ALWAYS use bullet_list
    - If there are numbers anywhere in the narration, STRONGLY prefer metric layout
    - When in doubt between text_narration and ANY other layout, ALWAYS choose the other layout

    ═══ CONTENT EXTRACTION ═══
    - Extract REAL content from the narration — NEVER fabricate data
    - For code_block: extract ACTUAL code, commands, or API calls mentioned — use real syntax,
      real variable names, real function signatures. If the narration says "use fetch()", write
      the actual fetch code. Include 3-8 lines that tell a story.
    - For bullet_list: pull out the ACTUAL items, features, or steps. Each bullet should be
      a concise phrase (5-10 words), not a full sentence. Max 6 bullets.
    - For flow_diagram: extract the ACTUAL process steps. Use short 2-4 word labels per step.
      Max 5 steps. Think: Input → Process → Validate → Transform → Output.
    - For metric: extract REAL numbers/percentages from the narration. If the narration says
      "reduces errors by 40%", use value="40", label="Error reduction", suffix="%".
    - For comparison: extract the ACTUAL two sides being compared. Use clear, contrasting labels.
    - For quote_callout: extract the KEY insight, definition, or quotable statement.
      Keep it to 1-2 impactful sentences. The quote should feel like a "pull quote" in a magazine.
    - For timeline: extract 3-4 chronological phases with short labels and 1-line descriptions.
    - For image_caption: use when the visual_description specifically mentions a diagram, 
      screenshot, or blog image. No extra props needed — the image is provided at runtime.

    ═══ LAYOUT SELECTION GUIDE ═══
    - Code, commands, config, API calls → "code_block" (shows a terminal with animated typing)
    - Lists of features, benefits, steps, takeaways → "bullet_list" (numbered animated points)
    - Processes, pipelines, architectures, data flows → "flow_diagram" (connected boxes with arrows)
    - Numbers, stats, percentages, KPIs, benchmarks → "metric" (giant animated counter)
    - Before/after, pros/cons, old/new, A vs B → "comparison" (split screen)
    - Key insight, definition, famous quote, important callout → "quote_callout" (accent bar + glow)
    - Explaining a screenshot, diagram, or visual from the blog → "image_caption" (image + text)
    - Chronological phases, version history, roadmap → "timeline" (vertical dots + staggered items)
    - General narrative that truly doesn't fit above → "text_narration" (geometric shapes + text)

    ═══ SMOOTHNESS ═══
    - Every layout has built-in animated transitions (fade-in, slide, scale, stagger)
    - Your job is to provide CLEAN, WELL-STRUCTURED data so the animations shine
    - Short, punchy text works better than long paragraphs
    - For bullets: each bullet = one clear idea, not a run-on sentence
    - For code: properly indented, syntactically correct, tells a mini-story in 3-8 lines
    - For metrics: round numbers with clear labels ("3x Faster", "97% Accuracy", "50ms Latency")

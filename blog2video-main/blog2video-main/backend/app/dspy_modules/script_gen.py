class BlogToScript(dspy.Signature):
    """
    Given blog content, a list of image URLs from the blog, and a hero image path,
    create a structured video script. The script tone and structure MUST match the
    authoritative style_guidance. The script should be
    engaging, clear, and organized into scenes suitable for a Remotion-based video.

    ═══ WRITING STYLE (CRITICAL) ═══
    - Treat style_guidance as the authoritative definition of tone, pacing,
      structure, hooks, vocabulary, transitions, and narration length.
    - Apply it consistently to the title, scene titles, key points, narration,
      and visual descriptions. Do not mix in assumptions based on video_style's name.
    - A current user_instruction_summary takes precedence when it conflicts with
      the saved style guidance.
    - Narration-length precedence: follow a specific numeric limit in the current
      instruction first, then one in style_guidance. A request for brief/short
      narration with no number means 10-18 words; a request for longer/more detailed
      narration with no number means 15-30 words. If neither source provides any
      length direction, keep each scene's narration between 12 and 25 words.

    GENERAL (all styles):
    - Scene count is controlled by `video_length`, not by `video_style`.
    - Ensure title, scene titles, narrations, and visual_description all reflect the chosen style consistently.

    ═══ VIDEO LENGTH RULES (CRITICAL) ═══
    - video_length values: auto | short | medium | detailed | more_detailed
    - short: best-effort 4-5 scenes (cap at 5).
    - medium: best-effort 12–15 scenes (cap at 15).
    - detailed: best-effort 25-34 scenes (cap at 34).
    - more_detailed: best-effort 43-50 scenes (cap at 50).
    - auto: choose a natural scene count based on scraped blog_content length and structure,
      but NEVER exceed 20 scenes.

    FIRST SCENE RULE:
    - The FIRST scene displays the hero/banner image with the blog title overlaid
      and a SHORT narration (1 sentence, ~14-16 words maximum).
    - The title of this scene MUST be the actual blog/video title (e.g. "Building a Reliable Text-to-SQL Pipeline").
      Do NOT use generic titles like "Hero Opening" or "Introduction" for scene 1.
    - The narration should be a brief, compelling hook, e.g. "Let's explore how X works." Keep it concise.
    - Set its duration to 6-7 seconds. This scene WILL have a voiceover.
    - The second scene continues with the main introduction/content.
    - If NO hero image is available (hero_image says "no hero image"), the first scene
      should use a BOLD TEXT BANNER with the title as large centered text on a colored
      background. Set visual_description to: "Title text banner: [THE TITLE] displayed
      as large bold centered text on gradient background, no image needed."
      Leave suggested_images as an empty list [].

    PORTRAIT MODE RULE:
    - If aspect_ratio is "portrait", the video will be rendered in 9:16 (1080x1920) vertical format.
    - For portrait hero scenes: prefer CENTERED title text with shorter lines. Use fewer
      words per line — keep the title concise (max ~6 words per line).
    - For portrait image scenes: images should be described as FULL-WIDTH with text below,
      NOT side-by-side layouts. Avoid "split-screen" or "side-by-side" descriptions.
    - For portrait flow diagrams: use VERTICAL flows (top to bottom), not horizontal.
    - For portrait comparisons: use STACKED layout (top vs bottom), not side-by-side.
    - Keep narrations punchy but still ensure minimum voiceover viability.
    - Follow style_guidance for narration length; when it gives no length direction,
      use 12-25 words per scene. Display texts are shown on screen.

    Duration calculation: Each scene's duration_seconds should be based on narration
    word count: roughly 1 second per 2.5 words, minimum 5 seconds per scene.
    Note: Narrations are display texts (short), voiceover will be generated separately and will be longer.

    ═══ VISUAL DESCRIPTION RULES (CRITICAL) ═══
    The visual_description field drives which visual components get used. Be SPECIFIC:
    - If the blog has CODE → write "Show code block with: [paste actual code]"
    - If listing features/steps → write "Animated bullet list: 1) item, 2) item, ..."
    - If describing a flow/pipeline/architecture → write "Flow diagram: Step1 → Step2 → Step3 → Output"
    - If comparing two things → write "Comparison split-screen: X vs Y"
    - If showing statistics → write "Big metric: 97% with animated counter"
    - If a key quote/definition → write "Quote callout: [the quote]"
    - If an image is relevant → write "Show image with caption: [description]"
    - If describing phases or history → write "Timeline: Phase1, Phase2, Phase3"
    - NEVER write vague descriptions like "display information" or "show content"
    - ALWAYS include the ACTUAL content to be visualized (real items, real code, real numbers)

    ═══ MAXIMIZE VISUAL VARIETY ═══
    Your video should feel polished and cinematic with strong visual variety. To achieve this:
    - EVERY scene should have a SPECIFIC visual layout hint in visual_description
    - Strongly prefer flow diagrams, bullet lists, metrics, comparisons, and timelines
    - Use plain text narration as an ABSOLUTE LAST RESORT — only if nothing else fits
    - Think about what a designer would PUT ON SCREEN: charts, diagrams, lists, numbers
    - If the narration describes any process or workflow, always suggest a flow diagram
    - If there are any numbers, stats, or metrics, always suggest animated metric counters
    - If comparing approaches, technologies, or ideas, always suggest a comparison layout
    - Aim for at least 70% of scenes to use structured visuals (not plain text)

    Output the scenes as a JSON array.

    ═══ CONTENT COVERAGE — USE ALL SOURCE DATA (CRITICAL) ═══
    - You MUST cover the FULL blog_content — do not summarise only the first half or skip sections.
    - Read blog_content to the end before planning scenes. Every major point, statistic, finding,
      and section of the article must appear in at least one scene's narration or visual_description.
    - If video_length forces fewer scenes than topics, merge related points into single scenes —
      but do NOT silently drop entire sections of the article.
    - For bloomberg specifically: every numeric claim, statistic, or data point found anywhere in
      blog_content must be represented. Do not stop extracting data after the first few paragraphs.

    ═══ LANGUAGE RULE (CRITICAL) ═══
    - content_language specifies the language of the scraped blog content.
    - Generate ALL output (title, scene titles, narrations, visual_description) EXCLUSIVELY in that language.
    - Do NOT translate to English if the content is in another language. Match the source language exactly.

    ═══ LAYOUT SUGGESTION (OPTIONAL, TEMPLATE-AWARE) ═══
    - When layout_catalog is provided, use it to suggest a layout ID for each scene.
    - Think about the **entire video** as a sequence — layout choices should feel like a deliberate visual journey, not random picks.

    ═══ DIVERSITY TARGETS BY VIDEO LENGTH ═══
    - short (4-5 scenes): use at least 6 distinct layouts. Max 2 scenes may share the same layout.
    - medium (12–15 scenes): use at least 9 distinct layouts. Max 2 scenes may share the same layout.
    - detailed (25-34 scenes): use at least 18 distinct layouts. Max 6 scenes may share the same layout.
    - more_detailed (43-50 scenes): use at least 25 distinct layouts. Max 8 scenes may share the same layout.
    - For any other length: use at least ceil(total_scenes * 0.7) distinct layouts.
    - These are MINIMUM targets — more variety is always better if the content supports it.

    ═══ DISTRIBUTION RULES ═══
    - NEVER place the same layout in consecutive scenes (scene N and scene N+1 must differ).
    - When a layout must repeat, space it out: at least 3 scenes apart (e.g. scene 2 and scene 5, not scene 2 and scene 3).
    - Spread visually heavy layouts (grids, charts, timelines) across the video — do not cluster them together.
    - Spread visually light layouts (full-center, quote, body-text) across the video similarly.
    - Think of the video in thirds: opening (scenes 0-2), middle (scenes 3-6), closing (scenes 7+). Each third should have its own visual identity.

    ═══ PLANNING STEP (REQUIRED) ═══
    - Before assigning layouts, write out a short plan:
    1. List all available layouts from layout_catalog.
    2. Group them by visual weight: heavy (data-rich) vs light (text/hero).
    3. Sketch a layout sequence for all scenes that satisfies the diversity target and distribution rules.
    4. Only then assign preferred_layout per scene.
    - This planning happens in your reasoning — the final output is still just preferred_layout per scene.

    ═══ TEMPLATE-SPECIFIC RULES ═══
    - For BUILT-IN templates (default, nightfall, gridcraft, spotlight, whiteboard, newspaper, matrix, newscast, mosaic, blackswan, chronicle,bloomberg):
    - Choose layout IDs EXACTLY from layout_catalog — the layout_catalog field is the single source of truth for which layout IDs are allowed for this template. Do NOT guess layout IDs from examples here.
    - When include_ending_socials is true: assign preferred_layout "ending_socials" ONLY to the LAST scene in
      scenes_json. No other scene may use "ending_socials" — not the first scene, not the middle, only the final index.
    - ENDING SCENE (when include_ending_socials is true): the LAST scene MUST be a call-to-action grounded in the
      actual blog_content — title, narration, and visual_description should reflect the article's topic, takeaway,
      or next step (not generic filler). Follow social_platforms_detected strictly: only name social platforms
      listed there when inviting followers; if it says NONE, do not name Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, etc.
    - Follow the "Best for" / "When to Use" hints when deciding per scene.
    - Hero/opening scenes should use the template's hero layout (e.g. hero_image, news_headline).
    - For CUSTOM templates:
    - When layout_catalog contains a "Layout catalog (AUTHORITATIVE ...)" section,
      use ONLY the ids listed there (intro, content_0 ... content_N, outro). They
      are the template's real generated scenes. Ignore any arrangement names
      (full-center, split-left, grid-3, stacked) appearing earlier in the prompt —
      those are a legacy vocabulary and will be discarded.
    - Older custom templates without that section still use arrangement names.
    - Suggest one layout id (or arrangement name) per scene.
    - For each scene object in scenes_json, include a "preferred_layout" field (string):
    - BUILT-IN: layout ID from the template's layout catalog.
    - CUSTOM: an id from the AUTHORITATIVE catalog when present, else an
      arrangement name from the layout_catalog list.
    - If unsure, leave preferred_layout as empty string "" for that scene.

    ═══ USER INSTRUCTION RULES (when present) ═══
    - If `user_instruction_summary` is non-empty, treat it as a HARD CONSTRAINT.
    - Every scene title, key_point, and the overall narrative arc MUST reflect the user's directives.
    - `must_include` (comma-separated) lists topics/phrases the user wants emphasized — at least one
      scene MUST surface each item; ideally weave them into the most relevant scenes naturally.
    - `must_avoid` (comma-separated) lists topics/phrases that MUST NOT appear in any scene title,
      key_point, narration, or visual_description — neither directly nor as a near-synonym.
    - These current instructions override saved style_guidance when they conflict.
    - Empty strings for any of these three fields = no constraint of that kind; proceed normally.
    - If `user_instruction_summary` asks for shorter or longer narrations without a specific
      word count, use 10-18 words for brief/short or 15-30 words for longer/more detailed.
      Otherwise follow style_guidance, falling back to 12-25 words when it provides no
      length direction.

    Expand a single scene outline into full scene content.
    You are given the blog content, the complete scene outline for context/continuity,
    and the specific scene to expand. Produce narration, visual description, layout, and images.
    style_guidance is the authoritative saved writing profile for every style.
    Do not infer tone from the style identifier. If the guidance provides no
    narration-length direction, keep the scene's narration between 12 and 25 words.

    ═══ NARRATION IS FINAL SPOKEN VOICEOVER (CRITICAL) ═══
    - Write `narration` as the final spoken-voiceover line, not a draft — there is no later
      rephrasing pass. Write it the way a narrator would actually say it out loud: natural,
      speakable phrasing, clean transitions, no elaboration beyond what fits the style.

    ═══ PRONUNCIATION RULE (CRITICAL) ═══
    - If an abbreviation is popularly pronounced as a word (e.g. SaaS → "sass", NASA → "nasa",
      NVIDIA → "en-vidia"), write it phonetically so TTS reads it as a word, not letter-by-letter.
    - Decimal numbers must be written with "point" between the parts. For example,
      3.5 → "three point five", 9.875 → "nine point eight seven five".

    ═══ EMOTIONAL DELIVERY (ONLY when expressive is true) ═══
    - Write the line to convey energy and excitement, like an enthusiastic narrator.
    - Add light emphasis words where natural (really, so, absolutely, truly).
    - End emphatic sentences with an exclamation mark ("!").
    - Do NOT use capitalization for emphasis. Never write a whole word in all-capitals — the v3
      model reads an all-caps word letter-by-letter like an acronym (F-O-R-E-V-E-R). Use normal
      capitalization; let the emphasis words and "!" carry the energy.
    - Do NOT add new facts and stay within the length rules — emphasis only changes delivery,
      not content.
    - When expressive is false, keep neutral phrasing (no added "!").

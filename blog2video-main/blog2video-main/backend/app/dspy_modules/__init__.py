# Disabled. Measured against the live Z.AI API: for a trivial component request,
# thinking consumed 1825 of 1986 completion tokens (92%) at reasoning_effort
# "low", and 1005 of 1338 at "minimal". Disabled, the same request used 286
# tokens — all of them content.
#
# On the real ~30k-char codegen prompt that overhead exhausted max_tokens before
# the `code` field was emitted, so the call returned an EMPTY string after
# ~145-300s. It hit content scenes specifically because their reward penalties
# push scores under Refine's 0.75 threshold, and Refine retries at escalating
# temperature (up to 1.0) where GLM's thinking grows repetitive — hence the
# "consider increasing the temperature ... if the reason is repetition" warning,
# which is inverted here.
#
# DSPy's own ChainOfThought rationale field is untouched: the model still plans
# its answer, it just does not also burn budget on a second private pass.
# NOTE: this switch only exists on 5.2 and earlier. The 5.3 line "always engages
# in thinking and cannot be disabled" (Z.AI error 1210) — if CUSTOM_TEMPLATE_LM
# is ever pointed there, _make_zai_lm silently caps the EFFORT instead and this
# flag becomes "use the cheapest tier". The measurements above are 5.2's.
_CODEGEN_THINKING = False
# The reasoning tier for codegen. "low" everywhere.
#
# On 5.2 and earlier this is a NO-OP while _CODEGEN_THINKING is False (Z.AI
# ignores reasoning_effort when thinking is disabled).
#
# On the 5.3 line it is LOAD-BEARING, because thinking cannot be switched off at
# all: _make_zai_lm sends this instead of the disable switch, so "low" is the
# floor rather than a starting point. That is deliberate — it is the cheapest
# legal tier and leaves the most of max_tokens for the `code` field, which is
# the exact failure mode documented above.
#
# The wider GLM family takes max/xhigh/high/medium/low/minimal/none; the 5.3 line
# takes ONLY low/high/max, so _make_zai_lm clamps this for a 5.3 model.
#
# DO NOT set this to "medium" on the 5.3 path. It is not a legal 5.3 tier:
# _GLM53_EFFORT_ALIASES silently maps it UP to "high" (the opposite of what the
# name suggests), and an unaliased illegal tier fails the call outright with the
# same Z.AI error 1210 as the disable switch. "medium" is also the specific
# setting measured to cause the truncations described above.

# median code is ~2.6k tokens, p99 ~5.5k, plus the CoT rationale and the four
# numeric fields — roughly 6k of actual answer.
#
# 12000, set deliberately. This is a CEILING, not a reservation: unused budget
# costs nothing, so this number only changes behaviour on calls that would
# otherwise have exceeded it. 12000 leaves ~6k for reasoning on top of the ~6k
# answer, which is comfortable on 5.2 with `thinking: disabled` (the historical
# value was 12000 for exactly that reason).
#
# THE RISK IT CARRIES on the 5.3 line: 5.3 cannot disable thinking, so reasoning
# is emitted into this same pool even at reasoning_effort="low". An exhausted
# pool does NOT truncate gracefully — it returns an EMPTY `code` field after a
# full-length call (~145-300s), which then costs a repair. The one measurement
# on record is 1825 of 1986 completion tokens spent on reasoning for a TRIVIAL
# request; the real ~30k-char codegen prompt is not trivial, and that figure was
# taken on 5.2.
#
# The mitigation is get_custom_lm_fallback(): a scene that comes back empty is
# retried on 5.2 with thinking off, where the whole pool is answer. Watch
# codegen_fallback_count() — if a large share of scenes are falling back, this
# budget is the cause and raising it is the fix, not more retries.

# Process-wide ceiling on SIMULTANEOUS calls to the custom-template provider.
#
# Tuning SCENE_CONCURRENCY alone does not bound provider load, because a scene
# is not one call. Each generated scene also runs _describe_scene_props (a
# separate dspy.Predict on get_scene_type_lm) inside the same task, and the
# repair pass adds more — so a window of N scenes puts well over N requests in
# flight, and the number that actually reaches the provider was never stated
# anywhere. That is why 429s survived cutting the scene window.
#
# Enforcing it HERE, on the LM, is what makes the bound true regardless of which
# code path issues the call: codegen, prop extraction, the critic and the design
# docs all queue against the same gate.
#
# 8 is below Z.AI's observed threshold (429s appeared at 11) with headroom for
# the retry traffic that a burst generates. Raise it only with 429 counts to
# show it is safe. NOTE this is a CONCURRENCY bound, not a rate: a permit is held
# for the duration of one call, so the requests-per-minute it implies depends
# entirely on how long calls take.
#
# ── Why the budget is SPLIT ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
# One workload can saturate this gate on its own: a custom-template generation
# runs SCENE_CONCURRENCY (8) scenes at once and each issues more than one call
# (codegen + _describe_scene_props, plus repairs), so it always has more work
# queued than there are permits. A semaphore has no notion of priority — waiters
# are just threads blocked on a counter — so anything else that arrives during a
# generation waits behind the whole batch. That is what made a scene edit hang
# long enough for the editor's poll to give up while the backend was still fine.
#
# So the budget is split by WORKLOAD, and only the saturating one is capped:
#
#   * custom-template GENERATION may hold at most _PROVIDER_TEMPLATE_INFLIGHT
#     permits — an LM built with capped=True, and
#   * everything else (video generation, scene edits) is uncapped: it may use the
#     whole gate when nothing else runs, and still has
#     _PROVIDER_MAX_INFLIGHT - _PROVIDER_TEMPLATE_INFLIGHT while a generation is
#     in flight.
#
# The flag is POSITIVE ("capped") and defaults False on purpose. An LM added
# later is then uncapped by default, which costs throughput at worst; the
# inverse default would silently let new template work exceed the cap.

    dspy.LM is a thin wrapper over litellm.completion/acompletion, so any LiteLLM-

    isn't the code path image gen goes through.

    Trade-off vs _make_openrouter_lm (kept in this file, no longer called by
    default but still available): single provider (Z.AI's own infra) instead of
    OpenRouter's 26-provider routing/fallback pool, and no DeepSeek fallback — but

    (https://docs.z.ai/guides/llm/glm-5.2), NOT OpenRouter's `reasoning` schema —
    the two are different shapes for the same idea and are not interchangeable.

    reasoning_effort (GLM-5.2 only, per Z.AI's own API reference) is a sub-dial that
    ONLY takes effect when thinking=True — Z.AI's docs state it "takes effect when
    `thinking` is enabled"; passing it with thinking=False is a no-op. Accepted
    values: max (default), xhigh, high, medium, low, minimal, none. This is Z.AI's
    native field, not OpenRouter's reasoning.effort — different API, same idea, not
    interchangeable (same caveat as the thinking/reasoning split above).

"""Escalation detection for the support bot.

Decides when a turn should offer the "talk to a human" / "request this feature" form
instead of (or alongside) a documentation answer.

The LLM metadata call is the primary decision-maker (see METADATA_SYSTEM_PROMPT_TEMPLATE
rule 4). These regex nets are deterministic backstops for two cases the LLM misses:

  * terse phrasings ("human speak", "i need help", "I need further assistance")
  * the metadata call failing entirely — it swallows LLMError and returns empty
    metadata, which would silently lose the escalation

Every pattern here was tuned against the real user questions in the support_messages
table. The must-NOT-fire half matters more than the must-fire half: over-escalating
interrupts a perfectly good answer, which is worse than missing one.

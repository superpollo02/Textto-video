"""Regression eval for the support bot. Run this after ANY change to the prompts,
the retriever, or the escalation logic.

    cd backend && python3 -m app.support.eval_support           # fast, no LLM calls
    cd backend && python3 -m app.support.eval_support --full    # + live LLM suites

Three suites:

  1. ESCALATION  — should the turn offer the "talk to a human" form? (no LLM needed)
  2. NO_APOLOGY  — real questions that must get a real answer, not a canned refusal
  3. CONTENT     — answers that already work must keep working, plus the
                   feature-truth and never-promote-competitors guards

Almost every question below is a VERBATIM question from the support_messages table.
They are the actual failures users hit, not invented examples.

Over-escalation (offering the form on a normal question) is reported separately from
misses: it interrupts a perfectly good answer, so it is the more damaging failure.

        {"error": "..."}                      (terminal, if a frame fails)

    Streaming rather than returning one JSON blob because each frame is a real
    render (~3-4s). The client needs to show which slide it is on, and doing that
    with one HTTP request per slide instead would re-run the workspace sync and
    re-bundle every time — measured at ~89% slower end to end.

    render service completely untouched (this endpoint wrote `raw` straight to
    disk, and the render service just writes the bytes it receives), so a phone
    photo arrived tagged Display P3, possibly with an alpha channel and 4000px
    wide. The render service reads raw pixels and assumes sRGB, which is why a
    custom avatar's colour drifts through the clip while a preset never does.

    Four things, in this order — the order is the substance:

      1. EXIF rotation, FIRST. A phone stores a portrait shot as landscape plus an
         orientation tag; every step below works on pixels, so the rotation has to
         be baked in before them or the avatar renders sideways.
      2. ICC -> sRGB, BEFORE convert("RGB"). `convert` drops the profile without
         applying it, so a P3 image would keep its wrong numbers and merely lose
         the metadata saying they were wrong.
      3. Flatten alpha onto white. Pillow's RGB conversion leaves transparent
         regions BLACK, which is worse than the fringing being fixed. (A
         1920x1080 RGBA png did exactly this once: white fringing and a yellow
         smear baked into the mp4 before matting ever ran.)
      4. Cap the size and re-encode as JPEG. One predictable format is the point.

    Raises on an undecodable image — the caller turns that into a 400. Storing it
    anyway would just move the failure to a render six minutes later.

                is exactly what the retry budget exists for. Only a scene that
                has genuinely exhausted its attempts is failed, which lets the
                refund sweep below close it out.

    attempt_count is never fabricated here. It used to be slammed to
    AVATAR_MAX_ATTEMPTS purely so the refund sweep would pick the row up, which
    laundered "we restarted" into "you used all three attempts" — a scene killed
    mid-first-render was stamped 3/3 and reported as having failed three times
    without ever finishing one. The count now only ever records attempts that
    really happened, and the refund follows from it honestly.

    DISABLED 2026-08-10. This sweep cannot tell a dead render from a live one:
    since renders moved to Modal the GPU job runs in a container that OUTLIVES
    this process, so a restart kills the HTTP request waiting on the result, not
    the render. Marking those rows failed refunded scenes that then completed
    normally minutes later — 11 avatars across projects 1146/1155/1156 were
    delivered AND refunded, and users were told "we couldn't generate" for
    videos sitting on disk.

    Leaving the rows untouched is strictly safer than guessing: a `queued` row
    is still claimed by the dispatcher on its next tick, and a `running` row
    whose render lands completes itself through the normal terminal path. The
    only thing lost is cleanup of genuinely-dead rows, which now stay `running`
    until someone clears them by hand — a stale row, not a wrong refund.

    Refunds now happen ONLY through refund_exhausted_avatar_failures, i.e. when
    a scene has really burned all AVATAR_MAX_ATTEMPTS attempts or died on a
    terminal (retryable=False) error.

    TO RE-ENABLE: delete the early return below. Do not re-enable without a way
    to test whether a render is actually still alive (a Modal status endpoint,
    or a heartbeat that stamps the job row — the current one only runs SELECT 1
    to keep the connection pool warm and never touches the row).

    first, then the purchased ``ai_edit_credits`` pool for any remainder — same

    A payer whose combined budget cannot cover the whole batch is refused —
    there is no partial batch. FREE users can still generate avatars as long as

    ONE charge for the whole batch, deliberately — not per scene. The wizard
    fans out N parallel POSTs to the per-scene endpoint, and consume_* is a
    non-atomic read-modify-write, so charging there would let concurrent
    requests read the same balance and systematically under-charge. Worse, a
    user could be charged for scenes 1-3 and rejected on 4-10, left with a
    part-finished batch and spent credits. Authorizing once removes both.

    Also deliberately: the deduction happens BEFORE the work, unlike
    add_scene/regenerate_scene which deduct after theirs succeeds. Those are
    synchronous — a mid-flight raise aborts before the deduction, which is why
    they need no refund path. Avatar renders are queued and asynchronous, so
    there is no single request whose success we could hang the charge on.

    Retries are NOT charged again (see avatar-retry-failed): the user already

    # to the wizard's default first-N and a 7-scene batch rendered as 5. Seeding
    # from `scenes` instead swaps that for the opposite error: on a project with an
    # earlier run, a NEW 7-scene batch renders as 14 with the previous 7 already
    # "Done". Only the server can tell the two runs apart.

    # or hours apart. Grouping by a short window off the newest row therefore
    # isolates a run with no extra column.
    #
    # It is a WINDOW and not an equality test because created_at is a per-row
    # server_default: rows in the same INSERT differ in the microseconds, so
    # `created_at == max(created_at)` matches exactly one job and reported a
    # 7-scene batch as 1. The window only has to be wider than one transaction
    # and narrower than the gap between two runs; a minute clears both by orders
    # of magnitude. Rows from other sources (a per-scene retry, a fallback matte)
    # get their own timestamp and correctly form a run of one.

    Audio files are named by ``scene.order`` (``scene_{order}.mp3``), and both the

    embedded in ``voiceover_path``. When ``order`` is renumbered (add-scene, reorder)
    the files and paths are left pointing at the OLD order, so scenes end up playing
    each other's audio — and a freshly generated ``scene_{order}.mp3`` can overwrite a
    file another scene still owns. This resyncs disk + DB to the current order.

    Playback resolves a scene's audio by FILENAME and then serves the matching Asset's
    ``r2_url`` when R2 is configured, so a correct rename must move BOTH the local file
    AND the R2 object (and update ``r2_url``/``r2_key``) — renaming the local file alone
    leaves production serving stale remote audio under the old name.

    Call AFTER every scene's ``scene.order`` is set to its final value and flushed, and
    BEFORE generating any new voiceover for the current order (so the new file can't
    clobber an existing scene's audio). Renames go through a temp name first so a cyclic
    remap (e.g. 2↔3) can't overwrite a file/object that hasn't been moved yet. Best-effort:

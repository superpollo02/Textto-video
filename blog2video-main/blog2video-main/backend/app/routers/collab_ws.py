"""Real-time collaboration websocket: live co-editing + presence.

One "room" per project holds every connected collaborator's socket. Inbound
``edit`` messages apply directly to the live Scene/Project rows (see
services/collab_draft.py), write attributed history, and are broadcast to everyone
else in the room. Presence and soft per-scene locks are broadcast but not
persisted.

PROD CAVEAT: rooms are in-process. With multiple uvicorn workers/instances a
message only reaches sockets on the same process. For horizontal scaling, back
``ConnectionManager`` with Redis pub/sub (publish every broadcast, each worker
subscribes and fans out to its local sockets) or run collaboration on a single
worker. This is documented as the scaling requirement; the single-process path
is correct and complete.

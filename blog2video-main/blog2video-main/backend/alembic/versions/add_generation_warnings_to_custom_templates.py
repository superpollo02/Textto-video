"""add generation_warnings to custom_templates

Stores a JSON array of human-readable warnings from the last code generation —
currently, scenes that exhausted their repair attempts and fell back to the
deterministic stub scene (§R Layer 3). Persisting them lets the UI show which
scene is degraded instead of the user discovering it in the rendered video.

Nullable with no default: existing rows stay NULL and are treated as "no
warnings", so this is a purely additive change.

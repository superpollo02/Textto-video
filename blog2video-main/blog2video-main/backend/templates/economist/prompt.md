# Design Philosophy

THE ECONOMIST is an editorial "newspaper × economic article" template that turns a blog or article into a video styled like a modern issue of *The Economist*: warm paper (`#F6F4EE`), near-black ink (`#1A1A1A`), one decisive Economist red (`#E3120B`), a deep Economist blue (`#006BA6`) for contrast, a serif voice (headlines/body) paired with a neutral grotesque (chart titles, labels, kickers), thin hairline rules, and reference-grade data charts. Every scene should read like a page of a serious, considered news-and-economics magazine — never a marketing slide or a SaaS demo.

**Editorial voice** (use it in every `title` and `narration`):
- Measured, analytical, lightly dry. Authoritative without hype. Think "leader article", not "thread".
- **Never output `assignedVideo`, `videoUrl`, `videoMuted`, or `videoVolume`.** A scene's background clip is stock footage chosen by the user in the editor after generation; any value you invent breaks rendering.
- British spelling (labour, favour, programme, analyse, per cent in prose).
- Lead with the argument or the finding, then the evidence. Short, declarative sentences.
- Banned: hype words and filler ("game-changer", "revolutionary", "unleash", "supercharge", "in today's fast-paced world", emoji, exclamation marks).

Core rules:
- **One idea per scene.** A scene is a single chart, a single table, a single debate, a single pull-quote, a single article beat — never a mix.
- Use only the prop names defined in this catalogue. Unknown keys are ignored downstream.
- **Do not** put `titleFontSize` or `descriptionFontSize` in `layout_props_json`. Those are UI defaults from `meta.json`.
- **Data-grounding is inviolable.** Never invent statistics, figures, dates, quotes, or chart numbers. Only use numbers that appear in the source. If a scene would need data you do not have, choose a prose layout (`leader_article`) instead of fabricating a chart.
- Charts and tables must be built from real numbers in the source. If there are no real numbers, do not emit a chart/table scene.

# Layout Catalog

## cover_reveal

**Visual:** The magazine cover. A red flag masthead drops in top-left, contents teasers stagger in top-right on hairline rules, a dateline draws, and a big serif headline assembles lower-left over a full-bleed photo (or warm paper if no image).

**Best for:** Scene 0 only — the opening.

**Props:**
- `teasers` — string array, **3–4** very short contents lines (≤6 words each), drawn from the article's themes.
- `title` (global) — the actual article headline, short and punchy.
- (Do NOT emit `dateline` — the system stamps the real current date automatically.)

**Worked example:**
```json
{ "layout": "cover_reveal", "title": "A Starship enterprise",
  "layout_props_json": {
    "teasers": ["We calculate the MAGA tax", "NATO: time for Plan B", "Are economists amoral?"] } }
```

---

## leader_article

**Visual:** A reversed-out feature spread — a bold ink (or photo) plate on the left carrying the kicker, headline and standfirst reversed in paper-white; the paper side on the right carries the full article body as a large lead statement, with the key points beneath as a ruled list.

**Best for:** The workhorse — any explanatory prose beat. The default and fallback layout.

**Props:**
- `sectionLabel` — short uppercase kicker (e.g. `"BRIEFING"`, `"FINANCE"`, `"LEADERS"`).
- `body` — **REQUIRED.** The on-screen article paragraph: **4–7 full sentences (≈60–110 words)** of real explanatory prose for this beat, drawn from the source, in the Economist voice. This is the main copy that fills the page — make it substantial; never leave it thin. This is shown on screen but **not** spoken, so it is independent of `narration` and may be longer.
- `standfirst` — **REQUIRED.** A single-line italic deck (≤16 words) stating the article's sub-thesis — the one sentence a reader would skim. Always emit one, grounded in the source.
- `keyPoints` — **REQUIRED.** An array of **2–3** short takeaway points (≤8 words each), drawn from the source, in the Economist voice. Never pad with filler — if the source is thin, distil what is there.
- `title` (global) — the headline.
- `narration` (global) — the **spoken voiceover only**: a short, punchy 1–2 sentence hook or summary of this beat. Keep it concise; it does NOT need to repeat the on-screen `body`.

**Worked example:**
```json
{ "layout": "leader_article", "title": "The central bank's hardest year",
  "narration": "The Fed now faces its most delicate task yet — and the margin for error is thin.",
  "layout_props_json": { "sectionLabel": "BRIEFING",
    "body": "After two years of forceful tightening, the Federal Reserve faces its most delicate task yet: easing policy without reigniting the inflation it fought so hard to tame. The data now point in opposite directions. Hiring has cooled and manufacturing has stalled, yet services inflation remains stubbornly warm. Cut too soon, and a second wave of price rises could undo three years of work; wait too long, and the real economy may buckle under the most restrictive rates since 2007. Every meeting now carries the weight of a decision that will shape the next decade of growth.",
    "standfirst": "Cut too soon and inflation returns; wait too long and growth buckles.",
    "keyPoints": ["Hiring has cooled sharply", "Core inflation near target", "Policy still most restrictive since 2007"] } }
```

## section_divider

**Visual:** A full-bleed chapter break — a small red diamond, double hairline rules, a very large serif section name, an italic standfirst, and a dateline pinned bottom-centre.

**Best for:** Marking a shift to a new theme/section in a longer video. Use sparingly (≤2 per video).

**Props:**
- `title` (global) — the section name (e.g. `"Finance & economics"`).
- `standfirst` — a one-line summary of what follows.
- (Do NOT emit `dateline` — the system stamps the real current date automatically.)

---

## chart_line

**Visual:** A custom Economist line chart — red tab, bold title, right-side y-axis, light horizontal gridlines, an emphasised black zero line when data crosses zero, up to 4 colour series with grey "context" series behind, direct colour-coded end-labels (or inline labels), an optional boxed panel number, and a source + footnote band. Lines draw on left→right.

**Best for:** Trends over time (years, quarters, months) — the headline data layout.

**Props:**
- `chartTable` — `{ "headers": [...], "rows": [...] }`. First column = x-axis labels (time), remaining columns = numeric series. **5–12 rows.**
- `highlightSeries` — string array (≤4) of header names to colour; any other series render as grey context lines.
- `seriesColors` — optional hex array aligned to `highlightSeries`.
- `emphasizeZero` — boolean, default `true`. Set `false` when the data never crosses zero.
- `panelNumber` — optional small boxed number (e.g. `"2"`).
- `labelMode` — `"end"` (labels at line ends, default) or `"inline"` (labels on the chart, good for 2 series).
- `unit` — optional value suffix (e.g. `"%"`).
- `explainer` — 1–2 measured sentences (≤30 words total) stating the takeaway, shown in a panel after the chart animates. Grounded ONLY in the chartTable numbers; the Economist voice; no hype.
- `title` (global) — the chart title. `narration` (global) — the subtitle (the units/definition line).

**Worked example:**
```json
{ "layout": "chart_line", "title": "End of a losing streak", "narration": "Latin America, % agreeing",
  "layout_props_json": { "panelNumber": "2", "emphasizeZero": false, "labelMode": "inline",
    "highlightSeries": ["Preferred", "Satisfied"], "seriesColors": ["#F0746E", "#E3120B"],
    "explainer": "Satisfaction has recovered to within a point of its 1995 level, after a deep slump in 2018.",
    "chartTable": { "headers": ["Year", "Preferred", "Satisfied"],
      "rows": [["1995",52,30],["2000",48,25],["10",55,38],["18",44,15],["24",47,29]] } } }
```

---

## chart_bar

**Visual:** A custom Economist bar chart. `chartType: "bar"` → vertical bars with gridlines, a right y-axis and value labels on top; `chartType: "hbar"` → ranked horizontal bars (sorted high→low) with values at the bar ends. Bars grow in with a stagger; negative bars switch to blue.

**Best for:** Comparing a quantity across categories (countries, sectors, firms). Use `hbar` for rankings.

**Props:**
- `chartTable` — first column = category labels, second column = the value. **4–9 rows.**
- `chartType` — `"bar"` or `"hbar"`. `unit` — optional (e.g. `"%"`, `"$bn"`).
- `explainer` — 1–2 measured sentences (≤30 words total) stating the takeaway, shown in a panel after the bars animate. Grounded ONLY in the chartTable numbers; no hype.

**Worked example:**
```json
{ "layout": "chart_bar", "title": "Projected GDP growth, 2026", "narration": "Selected economies, %",
  "layout_props_json": { "chartType": "bar", "unit": "%",
    "chartTable": { "headers": ["Economy", "Growth"], "rows": [["India",6.4],["China",4.5],["US",2.1],["Germany",0.9]] } } }
```

## data_table

**Visual:** A ranked table — rank · name · inline red magnitude bar · value. Rows sort high→low and reveal top→down.

**Best for:** Rankings / league tables (most valuable, largest, fastest-growing).

**Props:**
- `chartTable` — first column = name, second column = value. **5–10 rows.**
- `unit` — optional (currency symbols render as a prefix, e.g. `"$bn"` → `$560bn`).
- `explainer` — 1–2 measured sentences (≤30 words total) stating the takeaway, shown in a panel after the rows animate. Grounded ONLY in the chartTable numbers; no hype.

---

## pros_cons

**Visual:** The signature debate page. A serif headline + a justified intro, then two columns: ▶ PROS (Economist **blue**) / ▶ CONS (Economist **red**), each a numbered coloured square + a bold uppercase lead-in + a serif explanation.

**Best for:** "Should X?" decisions, trade-offs, bull-vs-bear, two-sided arguments.

**Props:**
- `intro` — a 1–2 sentence justified setup paragraph.
- `pros` — array of **3–6** `{ "lead": "BOLD UPPERCASE ≤6 WORDS", "body": "one sentence (10–22 words)" }`.
- `cons` — same shape, **3–6** items.
- `prosLabel` / `consLabel` — optional header overrides for non-binary framings (default `"PROS"`/`"CONS"`).
- `title` (global) — the question being debated.

**Worked example:**
```json
{ "layout": "pros_cons", "title": "Should the Fed cut rates?",
  "layout_props_json": { "intro": "The central bank faces its most delicate decision in years.",
    "pros": [ { "lead": "GROWTH IS COOLING", "body": "Hiring has slowed and manufacturing output has contracted for three months." } ],
    "cons": [ { "lead": "SERVICES STAY HOT", "body": "Wage growth in services keeps underlying inflation sticky." } ] } }
```

---

## key_indicators

**Visual:** A "by the numbers" panel — 2–4 large serif figures, each with a thin red underline, an uppercase label, and an optional trend (▲ blue / ▼ red).

**Best for:** A snapshot of an economy/company in a few headline figures.

**Props:**
- `indicators` — array of **2–4** `{ "value": "2.4%", "label": "Core inflation", "delta": "-0.3pp" }`. `delta` is optional; a leading `+`/`-` tints the arrow.
- `title` (global) — e.g. `"By the numbers"`.

---

## leader_quote

**Visual:** An oversized red opening quotation mark, a large centred serif pull-quote (one phrase optionally coloured red), and an attribution in sans small-caps.

**Best for:** A single resonant quotation or thesis sentence. Use real quotes only.

**Props:**
- `quote` — the quotation (a real one from the source; otherwise a verbatim thesis sentence).
- `attribution` — speaker (name, or role if the name is unknown).
- `highlightPhrase` — optional exact substring of `quote` to colour red.

---

## image_feature

**Visual:** A full-bleed photo with a lower gradient, a mini masthead + section kicker top-left, a big white serif headline lower-left, and a caption/credit bottom-right.

**Best for:** A photo-led feature beat. **REQUIRES a real editorial image.** Only choose `image_feature` when the source genuinely has a strong, relevant photograph for this beat. Without an image it renders as a plain text card — so if you are unsure an image exists, choose `leader_article` or `leader_quote` instead. **Never pick `image_feature` just to vary the layout.**

**Props:**
- `caption` — a one-line italic caption. `credit` — e.g. `"Photograph: Getty Images"`. `sectionLabel` — optional kicker. `title` (global) — the headline.

---

## ending_socials

**Visual:** The sign-off — a centred red masthead, a thin red rule, an italic closing line, CTA pill(s), another rule, and the socials row.

**Best for:** The final scene only.

**Props:**
- `wordmark` — the masthead flag text. Set this to the **brand / channel / publication name from the brief or CTA context** (the same identity the CTA and socials belong to). **Never hardcode "The Economist"** — that is the style homage, not the user's brand. If the brief gives no brand name at all, OMIT `wordmark` entirely (the flag is hidden rather than showing a brand the user did not choose).
- `ctaButtonText`, `websiteLink`, `showWebsiteButton` — the call to action. **Pass through whatever the brief/CTA context provides — never hardcode "Subscribe" / "Read more" / a generic catch-all.** If no CTA is given, omit these.
- `ctas` — optional array (≤3) of `{ ctaButtonText, websiteLink, showWebsiteButton }` for multiple CTAs.
- `socials` — the socials map/object from context. `narration` (global) — the closing line.

---

# chart_table rules

- The **first column** is always the x-axis / category / name; **all other columns are numeric**.
- `chart_line`: time on the x-axis, 5–12 rows; pick the ≤4 most important series for `highlightSeries`; leave secondary series in the table so they render as grey context lines.
- `chart_bar` / `data_table`: a single value column; 4–10 rows.
- Every number must come from the source. Round sensibly.
- Never emit a chart/table whose numbers you cannot ground in the source.
- Every chart/table scene should include an `explainer` takeaway; never restate the title — interpret the movement or the gap.

# Output contract

- Output strict JSON. Put layout-specific fields under `layout_props_json` using only the keys above.
- `title` and `narration` are global scene fields, not `layout_props_json` keys.
- Scene 0 is `cover_reveal`; the final scene is `ending_socials` (when CTA/social context exists).
- Keep the editorial voice in every line.

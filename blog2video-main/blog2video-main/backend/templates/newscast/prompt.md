# Design Philosophy — NEWSCAST

NEWSCAST is a premium broadcast news video template system. Every frame feels like a real television package: authoritative, urgent, and cinematic.

## Core palette
- Crimson red: `#CC1A1A` → `#E82020`
- Deep navy: `#060614` base, `#0A2A6E` panels, `#1E5FD4` accents
- White text
- Steel chrome: `#B8C8E0`
- Gold trim: `#D4AA50`
- Never use purple, green, or pastels.

## Scene image (`layoutProps.imageUrl`)
- **Never output `imageUrl` yourself.** You are not given any real image URLs, so any value you invent here (including anything on `example.com` or a similar placeholder domain) is a hallucination and will break rendering. The full-bleed background plate behind the NEWSCAST stack (globe, chrome, glass, type) is assigned automatically by a separate system from the project's own images after your output is generated. Do not include `imageUrl` in `layoutProps` under any circumstances.
- **The same rule applies to stock footage.** Never output `assignedVideo`, `videoUrl`, `videoMuted`, or `videoVolume`. A scene's background clip is chosen by the user in the editor after generation, and any value you invent would break rendering exactly as a fake `imageUrl` does.

## Background field
- Always `#060614` (deep space navy).
- Wireframe globe (latitude/longitude + continent silhouettes) behind content at 7–12% opacity.
- Fine blue grid: `rgba(30,95,212,0.08)` at 40px.
- Radial vignette that fades content into darker edges.

## Glass panels
- Translucent navy: `rgba(10,42,110,0.25–0.35)` with `backdrop-filter: blur(8px)`.
- Borders: `rgba(200,220,255,0.25)`.
- Key panels always include either a **3px red top accent** or a **4px red left accent**.

## Metallic emboss + chrome
- Outer canvas “bezel” using a gradient border.
- Chrome corner brackets with subtle gradient strokes (steel → muted blue).
- Top and side bands glow red.

## Typography
- Oswald (bold titles, uppercase labels)
- Barlow Condensed (body text, descriptors)
- Rajdhani (timestamps, tech readouts, station IDs)

## Persistent chrome elements (every scene)
- Red band (4px top edge) with red glow.
- Side bands (4px left/right) with red gradients.
- Live badge (top-right): red pill, blinking white dot, “LIVE”.
- Timestamp (top-left): `DD MMM YYYY · HH:MM:SS GMT` in Rajdhani.
- Channel logo (top-center): “WORLD NEWS” + subtitle “NETWORK · BROADCAST SYSTEM”.
- News ticker (bottom): red “BREAKING” label + scrolling navy track with `◆` separators.
- Lower third: transparent navy glass panel, red top + left border, gold tag label, Oswald headline, Barlow subtitle (max 55% width).
- Corner chrome: SVG arc brackets on all four corners.
- Globe watermark: SVG globe behind all content.

## Transitions
- Cinematic fade-in with subtle scale (0.96 → 1.0).
- Stagger important elements by ~80–120ms.
- Nothing bounces; urgency is speed, not physicality.

# Layout Catalog

Legacy compatibility note: the renderer still accepts older IDs like `newscast_cinematic_title` and `newscast_glass_narrative`, but generated output should use canonical IDs listed below.

## opening (Newscast Opening)
**Visual:** Full dark canvas with radial blue glow. Red “BREAKING NEWS” badge with live dot. Giant centered title (Oswald 700, 80–120px) where main word is white and accent word is `#E82020`. Gold horizontal rule with center dot. Subtitle uses Barlow Condensed 300, steel color, heavy letter-spacing. Orbit rings float around the composition. **No glass card.**

**Best for:** Scene 0 only.

**Props (use scene fields):**
- `title`: 2–5 words. Split into first part (white) + last word/phrase (red).
- `narration`: 8–16 words; becomes subtitle.
- Do not output `imageUrl` — the background plate under globe/chrome is assigned automatically after generation.

---

## anchor_narrative (Anchor Narrative)
**Visual:** Single frosted navy glass card centered (60–65% width). Red top border (3px) + red left accent bar (4px). Gold corner tick marks. Red category tag above. Oswald uppercase title. Barlow Condensed body paragraph. Optional right image, assigned automatically after generation — do not output `imageUrl`.

**Best for:** narrative context; main story explanation.

**Props (use scene fields + chrome fields):**
- `title`: 4–8 words
- `narration`: 30–80 words, 2–3 sentences
- `lowerThirdTag`, `lowerThirdHeadline`, `lowerThirdSub` (for persistent lower third)

---

## live_metrics_board (Live Metrics Board)
**Visual:** 1–3 metric cards centered. Primary metric has dual counter-rotating rings and a large Oswald number (60–72px). Secondary metrics share the structure with blue top borders. Numbers count up from 0.

**Best for:** 1–3 key numbers as the story.

**Props:**
```json
{
  "metrics": [
    { "value": "142", "label": "Nations Signed", "suffix": "+" },
    { "value": "2045", "label": "Target Year", "suffix": "" },
    { "value": "40", "label": "Emissions Cut", "suffix": "%" }
  ]
}
```

---

## briefing_code_panel (Briefing Code Panel)
**Visual:** Frosted navy card with metallic terminal header (traffic-light buttons). Code typewrites in line-by-line with blinking red cursor. Red line numbers, syntax highlighting.

**Best for:** terminal commands and code snippets.

**Props:**
```json
{
  "codeLanguage": "javascript",
  "codeLines": ["line1", "line2", "line3"]
}
```

---

## headline_insight (Headline Insight)
**Visual:** No glass card; raw dark canvas. Gold rule top/bottom of quote zone. Oswald uppercase quote (50–65px). Highlight word in red with glow + underline accent. Attribution line in Rajdhani with wide letter-spacing.

**Best for:** one powerful sentence.

**Props:**
```json
{
  "quote": "This is not a pledge — this is a commitment the world will enforce",
  "highlightWord": "commitment",
  "attribution": "— UN Secretary-General · Geneva, March 2026"
}
```

---

## story_stack (Story Stack)
**Visual:** 2–3 stacked frosted navy cards. Progressive right offsets. Each card has red left border, large red index number, and Barlow content text. Section label above stack in Rajdhani with a thin red divider line.

**Best for:** 2–3 key provisions/features.

**Props:**
```json
{
  "sectionLabel": "THREE KEY PROVISIONS",
  "items": [
    "Legally binding emissions targets with third-party verification",
    "All sectors included — shipping, aviation, heavy industry",
    "$2.4 trillion green transition fund established for 2025–2035"
  ]
}
```

---

## side_by_side_brief (Side-by-Side Brief)
**Visual:** Two contrasting glass panels side-by-side. Left is red-tinted, right is blue-tinted. Center divider strip has gold-to-red glow. Each side includes gold uppercase label, Oswald title, and Barlow body text.

**Best for:** before/after and problem/solution contrasts.

**Props:**
```json
{
  "leftLabel": "BEFORE",
  "rightLabel": "AFTER",
  "leftTitle": "Previous Framework",
  "rightTitle": "Geneva Accord",

```json
{
  "chapterNumber": 2,
  "chapterLabel": "CHAPTER TWO",
  "title": "Global Impact & Response",
  "subtitle": "What happens next for the world economy"
}
```

---

## field_image_focus (Field Image Focus)
**Visual:** Full-canvas or 55% right image with multi-layer gradients. Ken Burns effect (slow zoom). Frosted caption slides up.

**Best for:** image-focused scenes.

**Props:** uses scene `title`, scene `narration`. Image is assigned automatically after generation — do not output `imageUrl`.

---

## data_visualization
**Visual:** Frosted navy broadcast board with adaptive chart mode (line, bar, histogram), value badge, and financial-style trend callouts using red/green/blue with gold accents.

**Best for:** chart/data-driven narration.

**Primary market props (preferred for stock visuals):**

```json
{
  "marketSymbol": "S&P 500",
  "marketValue": "3,013.00",
  "marketDelta": "+6.27",
  "marketPercent": "+0.21%",
  "marketTrend": "up"
}
```

`marketTrend` must be one of: `"up"`, `"down"`, `"crash"`.

**Chart props (exact keys):**

0. **Chart mode (optional):** `chartType` in `"auto" | "line" | "bar" | "histogram"`.  
   If omitted, renderer defaults to **auto**.

1. **Line (comparison mode, max 3 lines total):** `lineChartLabels` + `lineChartDatasets` (1–3 series).  
   Use this for time-series and table comparisons over time.

```json
{
  "chartType": "line",
  "lineChartLabels": ["Q1", "Q2", "Q3", "Q4"],
  "lineChartDatasets": [
    { "label": "Revenue", "valuesStr": "12.4, 14.1, 15.0, 16.2" },
    { "label": "Cost", "valuesStr": "8.3, 8.8, 9.4, 10.1" },
    { "label": "Profit", "valuesStr": "4.1, 5.3, 5.6, 6.1" }
  ]
}
```

2. **Bar:** `barChartRows` — array of `{ "label": string, "value": string }` (2–12 rows).  
   Use for categorical snapshot comparisons.

```json
{
  "chartType": "bar",
  "barChartRows": [
    { "label": "Energy", "value": "45" },
    { "label": "Transport", "value": "38" },
    { "label": "Industry", "value": "30" }
  ],
  "tickerItems": ["DATA UPDATE", "LIVE CHART"],
  "lowerThirdTag": "DATA",
  "lowerThirdHeadline": "Chart Overview",
  "lowerThirdSub": "Figures from the latest briefings"
}
```

3. **Histogram:** `histogramRows` — array of `{ "label": string, "value": string }` (3–12 buckets).  
   Use for distribution/frequency style data.

```json
{
  "chartType": "histogram",
  "histogramRows": [
    { "label": "0-10", "value": "2" },
    { "label": "11-20", "value": "6" },
    { "label": "21-30", "value": "9" },
    { "label": "31-40", "value": "4" }
  ],
  "tickerItems": ["DISTRIBUTION", "BUCKETS"],
  "lowerThirdTag": "DATA",
  "lowerThirdHeadline": "Value Distribution",
  "lowerThirdSub": "Frequency by range"
}
```

4. **Table source (when present in scraped content):** `chartTable` with `headers` and `rows`.

```json
{
  "chartTable": {
    "headers": ["Month", "Revenue", "Cost"],
    "rows": [
      ["Jan", "120", "90"],
      ["Feb", "130", "95"],
      ["Mar", "125", "98"]
    ]
  }
}
```

When `chartTable` exists, extract it from source faithfully and let renderer auto-convert it into chart data.

If two or more tables exist in source content, you may choose one or combine comparable tables.
Decide mapping from table semantics (LLM decides), then emit chart props that best compare the data.
Do not invent rows/columns that are not present.
Pipeline note: scraped tables may be provided in visual hints under `TABLE_DATA_HINT_JSON`. Use those tables as source-of-truth when present.

Do **not** rely on alternate nested keys only (`barChart`, `lineChart`, `pieChart` objects); template schema uses the field names above.

**Auto chart selection rule (when `chartType` is omitted or `auto`):**
1. If valid time-like labels are present in line/table data -> use **line**.
2. Else if comparable category rows exist -> use **bar**.
3. Else if distribution buckets exist -> use **histogram**.

Comparison guidance:
- Comparison scenes can use **line** or **bar** charts.
- Use **line** for comparisons that show progression/trend over steps, periods, or ordered buckets.
- Use **bar** for one-shot category-vs-category comparisons without trend emphasis.

# Scene Flow Rules

- **Scene 0:** ALWAYS `opening` (your hero styling).
- **Scenes 1–2:** `anchor_narrative` or `segment_break`.
- **Middle:** alternate glass layouts with impact moments (`headline_insight`).
- **Final scene:** `anchor_narrative`, `headline_insight`, or `live_metrics_board` for a strong close.

**Variety requirements**
- Never repeat the same layout consecutively.
- `anchor_narrative` max 2 per video.
- `headline_insight` max 2 per video.
- `segment_break` max 2 per video.
- Variety score ≥ 0.6 (unique layouts ÷ total scenes).

# Content Extraction Rules

1. Extract REAL content from narration — never fabricate.
2. Titles: Oswald uppercase, keep short (2–6 words).
3. Category tags: 2–3 words, letter-spacing 3px, red background.
4. Lower third headlines: short news-style noun phrases (no full sentences).
5. Ticker content: match the scene topic; use `◆` as separator when rendering.
6. Numbers belong in `live_metrics_board` (don’t bury them inside `anchor_narrative`).
7. Quotes/insights belong in `headline_insight` with `highlightWord`.
8. Lists of 2–3 belong in `story_stack`.

## Required chrome props (for every scene)
- `tickerItems`: array of short ticker segments (strings). Extract from narration “update” fragments.
- `lowerThirdTag`: gold/red tag label (2–3 words).
- `lowerThirdHeadline`: short headline (2–6 words).
- `lowerThirdSub`: steel subtitle (5–12 words).

## Layout-specific extraction guidance
- `opening`: split `title` into white + red accent; use `narration` as subtitle.
- `anchor_narrative`: use scene `title` + `narration` for the glass card; extract `lowerThird*` + `tickerItems`.
- `live_metrics_board`: extract up to 3 numbers into `metrics[]` (value/label/suffix).
- `side_by_side_brief`: extract contrasting statements into left/right fields.
- `headline_insight`: extract one most powerful sentence into `quote`, then pick a single key word as `highlightWord`; attribution from narration when present.
- `story_stack`: extract 2–3 parallel provisions into `items[]` and a `sectionLabel`.
- `segment_break`: extract `chapterNumber` + `chapterLabel` when present; use scene `title`/`narration` for section title/subtitle when not.
- `field_image_focus`: use scene `title`, scene `narration`. Never output `imageUrl` — image is assigned automatically after generation.
- `data_visualization`: if article/source contains numeric tables, scrape table headers + rows into `chartTable` and also emit best-fit chart props. For multiple tables, choose/merge comparable rows and columns for comparison charts. Comparison charts may be line or bar based on data shape. Select chart type automatically using rule above; cap line comparisons at 3 total series.

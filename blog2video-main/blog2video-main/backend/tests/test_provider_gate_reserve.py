"""
The provider budget is split by WORKLOAD so template generation cannot starve
video generation or scene edits.

Custom-template generation is the one workload that saturates the gate on its
own — SCENE_CONCURRENCY (8) scenes, each issuing more than one call — and a
semaphore has no notion of priority, so before the cap anything arriving during
a generation waited behind the whole batch.

These pin the three properties that make the split real:
  1. capped (template) work never exceeds _PROVIDER_TEMPLATE_INFLIGHT,
  2. uncapped work gets through while template work saturates its cap, and
  3. uncapped work ALONE can still reach the full _PROVIDER_MAX_INFLIGHT —
     "if nothing else is running, take everything".

"""The per-content-type prop schema, and the drift it exists to prevent.

WHY THIS EXISTS

A comparison scene shipped with

    {"contentType": "comparison",
     "left":  {"label": "Order food in", "description": "..."},
     "right": {"label": "Dine out",      "description": "..."}}

while GeneratedSceneProps declares `comparisonLeft` / `comparisonRight`. The
component read the contract keys, found nothing, and drew an empty frame.

Nobody was wrong in isolation. The scene code followed the contract; the
classifier followed its prompt, which described the fields in prose ("comparison:
left and right sides") and never named them. And no layer in between renames
keys — sanitizeSceneProps coerces SHAPES and skips anything it does not
recognise, so `left` travelled all the way to the component untouched.

The template sample-copy path had a correct per-type key map all along. The
project-content path did not. These tests pin the shared schema that closes that
asymmetry, and the aliasing that repairs rows already in the database.

"""Custom-template scene resolution, image capability, and routing.

Covers four defects reported together on the custom-template flow:

  1. IMAGES AND CLIPS WERE ASSIGNED, THEN STRIPPED. On a project's first run the
     pipeline writes descriptors carrying only structuredContent and an EMPTY
     layoutConfig — no scene type, no variant index. `_custom_layout_id` cannot
     resolve those, and the old fallback handed EVERY scene the template's
     fallback layout (`content_0`). Whenever that one layout happened to be
     image-free, the whole video was treated as image-free: every assignedVideo
     dropped, every assignedImage popped, and `hideImage: True` persisted so it
     could never heal. `_resolve_custom_scene_types` is the fix, and it must run
     before the image cascade.

  2. THE TEMPLATE'S OWN OUTRO WAS OVERWRITTEN. A v2 outro composes the CTA
     itself and renders as its own scene, so it may legitimately carry an image.
     Two places forced it image-free regardless.

  3. PROPS WENT TO THE WRONG SCENE. Prop defaults were indexed by POSITION while
     the component that renders a scene is chosen by contentVariantIndex.

  4. CONTENT ROUTING IGNORED SECONDARY MATCHES, and naively widening `best_for`
     would have made it worse — a secondary tag on an early archetype could
     claim a type before a later archetype's PRIMARY was considered.

"""The staged generation pipeline: plan -> generate -> examine.

`generate_component_code` used to run every stage inside one ~370s call, and
`_persist_generated_variants` wrote only at the very end — so a crash at scene 7
of 9 threw away all nine. These tests cover the split into three independently
callable stages plus the per-scene callback that makes partial progress
durable.

The FIRST test here is the golden one: it pins the return shape of the composed
`generate_component_code` against the stages it now delegates to. Every caller
(`_run_codegen_background`, `_run_regen_background`) reads that dict by key, so
a decomposition that silently drops or renames one would break generation
without failing anything else in the suite.

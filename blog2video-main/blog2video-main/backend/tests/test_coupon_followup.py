"""
Post-checkout win-back coupon (_send_winback_coupon).

The win-back is now driven by Stripe's official abandoned-checkout signal:
``checkout.session.expired`` → ``_handle_checkout_expired`` → ``_send_winback_coupon``
(the old ~10-min daemon Timer / module-level ``SessionLocal`` design is gone).
``_send_winback_coupon`` applies the eligibility + dedup rules and picks the email:
  - abandoned (bought nothing)       → Email 1 (send_abandoned_checkout_coupon_email)
  - bought a single per-video credit → Email 2 (send_per_video_upsell_coupon_email)

Handlers are called directly; the DB is the test DB and email_service is patched.

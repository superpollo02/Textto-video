"""Failure-resilience tests for custom-template scene generation (§R).

These cover the layers that keep one bad scene from becoming a user-visible
failure. The stub test in particular is load-bearing: the stub is the last line
of defence, so an invalid stub would make the whole fallback path worthless —
and unlike LLM output, its correctness is entirely in our control.

No network: everything here is pure string/validation logic.

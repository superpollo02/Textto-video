It opens by putting your subject on the cover of a TIME-style magazine — masthead, cover lines, and hero portrait — then unfolds the rest as a designed print spread. Layouts like Magazine Cover, Feature, Editorial Quote, Interview Q&A, By the Numbers, and Colorblock give founder profiles, personal-brand pieces, and milestone announcements the weight and prestige of a published feature. Pull quotes, data charts, and ticker tables carry the substance, so the final video reads like a cover story a real editorial team art-directed rather than an auto-generated slideshow.",

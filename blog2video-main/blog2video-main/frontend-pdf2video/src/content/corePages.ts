          "Your first video is free, for life, and no card is required to make it. That free video is the full product — AI script generation, ElevenLabs voiceover, preview, one custom template, and an MP4 download. After that you either pay per video or move to a monthly plan. We would rather tell you that plainly than advertise 'unlimited free' and gate the download at the end.",
      },
      {
        question: "Do I need to create an account?",
        answer:
          "Yes — you sign in with Google before your first render. There is no card and no trial timer, but rendering video costs real compute, so an account is what stops the queue being consumed by bots. If you want to see the output quality before signing in, the templates section on this site has full example videos.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can I download the result as an MP4?",
        answer:
          "Yes. The finished video downloads as a standard MP4, which every platform accepts — YouTube, LinkedIn, Instagram, TikTok, Slack, your LMS, or a video embed on your own site. It works on mobile and desktop with no player plugin.",
      },
      {
        question: "Will there be a watermark on my video?",
        answer:

      },
      {
        question: "Do I have to record my own voice?",
        answer:
          "No. Narration is generated automatically with ElevenLabs voices, so a finished video needs no microphone and no recording session. You can change the voice at any point and re-render, and paid plans add premium voices and voice cloning if you want the narration to sound like you.",
      },
      {
        question: "How long can the video be?",
        answer:
          "There is no fixed cap — length follows the document. A dense 3,000-word report typically lands around five to eight minutes. Very long PDFs produce proportionally longer videos, and you can cut scenes you do not want before rendering.",
      },
      {
        question: "What kinds of PDFs work best?",

          "Born-digital PDFs with a real text layer and clear headings convert best: reports, whitepapers, papers, lesson plans, manuals, and decks exported to PDF. Scanned documents are essentially images of pages with no extractable text, so they give noticeably weaker results.",

      {
        question: "Can I apply my own branding?",
        answer:

        question: "Can Blog2Video actually generate a LinkedIn carousel, not just a video?",
        answer:
          "Yes. Once an article, PDF, or document is generated into scenes, you can export that same scene set as PNG slides, a PDF deck, or a PowerPoint file — all formats LinkedIn's carousel upload accepts.",

        question: "Do I need a video first to get a carousel?",
        answer:
          "No. Generating the scenes is the shared first step for both outputs. You can export straight to PNG, PDF, or PowerPoint without rendering or publishing a video.",

        question: "How is this different from a generic AI carousel generator?",
        answer:
          "Generic carousel generators usually start from a single prompt or idea and produce a templated hook-list-CTA sequence. Blog2Video starts from your actual article structure, so the carousel follows your real argument and examples instead of a generic format.",

        question: "What if I want to edit slides before exporting?",
        answer:
          "You can edit any scene's text, layout, or image after generation and before export, so the final PNG, PDF, or PowerPoint reflects your changes.",
